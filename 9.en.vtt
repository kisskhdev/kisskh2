[The child actors were filmed safely.]

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.620
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.670
She received my letter and went out?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.530
I looked everywhere,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.210
but she is not at Cheonggyecheon.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.210
I was away running an errand for Madam.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.760
Where am I?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.370
[Episode 9: The ones who were hurt]

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.270
- Your Excellency!
- Aigoo, Aigoo.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.470
Aigoo, Sun Chaek.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.950
Is there no news yet?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.260
No, not yet.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.180
If something happens to Sun Chaek,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.300
I will also leave this world immediately.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.440
Please do not say that.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.310
There is no time for this.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.360
Release all the servants in the house

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.830
and you should also look where she might be.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.920
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes, Madam.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.930
Let us go, Du Ho and Se Ho.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.950
Aigoo, Sun Chaek...

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.370
I am sure she will return soon.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.730
Gosh, Sun Chaek.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.140
Let us go.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.940
We are looking for the
Chief State Minister's daughter.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.360
This way.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.900
<i>Sun Chaek, where are you?</i>

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.730
Have you... Have you seen Sun Chaek?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.500
She is this tall and has a slender face.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.920
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.780
Make sure to tell us if you see her.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.890
- Sun Chaek!
- Sun Chaek!

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.520
Sun Chaek!

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.660
- Sun Chaek!
- Sun Chaek!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.310
My Lady! Lady Sun Chaek!

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.150
My Lady!

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.010
Lady Sun Chaek!

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.760
My Lady...

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.540
My Lady!

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.810
Look everywhere around here!

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.350
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.490
What on earth is going on?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.180
The Chief State Minister's daughter is missing.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.390
Everyone is looking for her.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.760
Did you hear, My Lady?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.720
The Chief State Minister's daughter is missing.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.760
All hell broke loose.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.980
Spare me.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.640
Spare me! Spare me!

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.940
There is no use.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.560
No one will hear you and come.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.870
What do you want from me?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.870
Die very painfully.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.130
That is what that person wants.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.540
Damn it.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.860
You crafty thing.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.400
You'd better stop now.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.430
For whose benefit?

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.860
You are hastening your death.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.280
My life is already in someone else's hands.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.250
Who ordered you to do this?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.550
Someone very important desperately wants you gone.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.880
No matter who they are,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.170
Prince Gyeongseong will not forgive them.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.250
I'm certain he will find me.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.010
I suppose Prince Gyeongseong could.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.100
But even if he got lucky and found you,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.440
it will be after you're dead.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.030
- Anything yet?
- My apologies.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.160
As you ordered, I released
all the soldiers to look for her.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.840
Did you find the servant
who delivered the fake letter?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.720
I ambushed their residence,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.960
but they had already fled.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.360
If there is no evidence,
we need to find witnesses.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.350
Yes, My Lord.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.370
Hold on!

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.390
Okay, I'll die.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.710
I'll die as you wish.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.580
I'm too exhausted to go on as well.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.730
What are you plotting?

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.480
I'm not plotting.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.560
I want to end my life beautifully.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.590
I don't want to be killed
gruesomely by a huge hammer.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.890
I'm still the Chief State Minister's only daughter.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.040
I want to have a beautiful death.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.350
If I'll die anyway,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.450
you can do that for me, at least.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.020
So, how do you want to die?

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.390
Well,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.580
so...

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.280
The way I want to die is...

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.890
You thought you could fool me, didn't you?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.140
What is going on?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.070
Maiden Sun Chaek disappeared?

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.530
Where did she disappear to?

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.290
Prince Gyeongseong sure is powerful.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.650
Wow.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.480
Because your fiancée went missing,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.710
you brought chaos to the capital.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.470
How touching your affection is for her.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.310
Looks like you are about to hit me.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.850
I could do something worse.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.330
You kill other people easily like flies.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.770
But I guess you cherish your fiancée's life.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.170
You should not be doing this now.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.580
I found a witness who reportedly
saw her at Cheonggyecheon.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.680
Where is the witness now?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.860
This way.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.330
Let us go.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.000
I am a ginseng digger.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.650
While I was descending the mountains this way,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.560
I think I saw an unfamiliar palanquin.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.900
An unfamiliar palanquin?

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.350
When was that?

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.730
It was about an hour ago.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.950
If so, they must be still around there.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.280
You can forget about dying beautifully.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.840
Don't kill him!

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.220
My Lady!

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.840
Maiden!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.150
- My Lady.
- Maiden.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.290
Are you okay, Maiden?

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.950
Are you okay, My Lady?

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.980
Oh, no. My Lady...

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.140
Please pull yourself together, My Lady.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.590
Bring him to me.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.160
- Yes, sir.
- My Lady.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.220
Cha Sun Chaek.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.330
This is not good.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.770
My Lady.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.870
<i>Could it be...</i>

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.420
<i>It cannot be.</i>

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.150
Sun Chaek!

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.760
Sun Chaek!

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.130
This way. This way.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.980
- Gosh, what's happened?
- Sun Chaek!

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.760
Oh, my gosh!

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.560
Aigoo, Sun Chaek.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.620
Should I bring a physician?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.310
What on earth is going on here?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.460
Her pulses are irregular due to shock,

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.800
but she seems to be deeply asleep.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.050
- All right.
- My Sun Chaek.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.260
Looks like she needs rest.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.460
Let us leave now.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.420
Let us leave.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.660
Are you leaving now?

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.490
- It is getting late. I will-
- Please rest here tonight.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.860
But first,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.490
how about a drink with me?

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.870
You seem very uncomfortable.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.600
I am not.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.060
I do not think I could sleep tonight
because of all the trauma.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.800
I need to drink first.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.810
This is our family's inherited...

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.830
authentic mountain ginseng wine.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:29.880
Thank you for letting Sun Chaek
return to me, My Lord.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.040
Once you have a child, you will learn

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.690
how it feels to cherish
someone more than yourself.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.180
If you outdrink me tonight,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.580
I will allow you to marry Sun Chaek.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.610
Do you think you can beat me?

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.490
Of course,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.620
I will lose.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.940
I suggested we drink because I wanted to lose.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.810
You are slow to read the air.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:24.250
Forget the wounds from the past with this wine.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.150
The hurtful words I said to you in the past

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:36.150
were said by the father, Cha Ho Yeol,
not the Minister, Cha Ho Yeol.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.370
If you had a daughter like Sun Chaek,

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.870
you will soon understand how I feel.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.300
She is in your care from now on.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.240
You kept your promise to...

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.140
protect Sun Chaek for me.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:05.050
Please always protect her like you did today.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.420
I will...

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.260
keep that promise even when I am dead.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.830
Then, let us drink...

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.270
the real mountain ginseng wine.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.450
Who told you to do this?

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.240
Spilling it now would be better for your sake.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.910
<i>It must mean there are that many people
who want you to see your blood.</i>

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.630
<i>Did you receive the letter I sent?</i>

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.410
<i>I cannot believe that he's being exiled.</i>

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.730
<i>I know.</i>

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.920
<i>I feel so sorry for him.</i>

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.100
<i>He is left alone. All alone.</i>

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.680
<i>The remaining ones need to go on.</i>

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.510
<i>What can you do...</i>

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.790
Cha Sun Chaek!

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.520
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.310
Cha Sun Chaek!

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.930
You're breaking out in cold sweats.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.370
Did you have a nightmare?

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.840
Why are you doing this first thing in the morning?

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.010
I thought I had lost you again.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:17.020
Because I've been through so much,

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.370
I pretty much got used to it.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.800
It is all my fault.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.220
How is it your fault?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.160
I worry my enemies would threaten you

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.060
and my misfortune would affect you.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.740
For the first time, I wondered...

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.560
if my love for you might be too selfish.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.430
Prince Gyeongseong, why did you get so weak?

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.390
Once you love someone,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:56.210
you share happiness and sadness together.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.830
If I could alleviate your misfortune,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.330
it would make me happy.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.460
And if we end up sharing the misfortune,

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.570
my good fortune will reach you as well.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.440
Chief State Minister... I mean...

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.970
Father-in-law gave us his approval.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.930
Really?

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.550
You did it, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.440
See? What did I tell you?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.080
Please have faith in your lucky charm,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.570
Cha Sun Chaek, in the future, too.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.200
I thought I lost this.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.700
It reconnected us as the name suggested.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.240
I will never lose it again.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.770
<i>Seeing what I read about in the novel</i>

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.050
<i>in person made me feel afraid.</i>

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.670
<i>Don't kill him!</i>

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.970
<i>But...</i>

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.720
<i>I don't want Prince Gyeongseong
to kill any more people.</i>

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.750
<i>Even if it is to protect me,</i>

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.870
<i>it can't happen.</i>

00:23:57.463 --> 00:23:59.240
It was chaotic last night.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.230
The Do family did that?

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.060
Probably Lady Do Hwa Seon, to be exact.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.110
Yes, who else in the capital would do that?

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:12.310
<i>Lady Do loved Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.180
<i>Yes, she is more than capable.</i>

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.670
I think people are talking about me.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.280
I kidnapped Chae Sun Chaek?

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.360
They blame me whenever something happens to her.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.840
Did you do it?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.640
F-Father.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.460
I asked if you did it.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.800
No, Father.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.140
Who was it, then?

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.940
Why would you ask me that?

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.270
It was not me.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.870
Are you deceiving me now?

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.020
I am innocent.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.540
It sounded like...

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.350
something I could have done, but...

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.430
What?

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.700
I am just saying that. It really
was not me this time.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.460
You are mistaken.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.570
Stay at a temple for now.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:21.430
- Pardon?
- Be away until things quiet down.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.110
I am saying it was not me.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.010
I can only tolerate you so much.
Do you understand?

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.100
He has not spoken a word yet.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.030
They copied my handwriting.
[Come to Cheonggyecheon...]

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.250
They are really something.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.540
Who was it?

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.220
If you confess, I will let you live.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.080
I promise.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.320
My Lord said he will let you live.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.210
Confess and save your life, you bastard!

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.820
If you miss your chance to confess,

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.760
you will experience the worst pain possible.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:50.930
Sir.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.470
Maiden.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.890
Did you come to see me today again?

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.740
The capital was in shambles last night.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.250
You mean about Lady Sun Chaek?

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.990
Did you hear, too?

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.470
Of course.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.180
What on earth is going on?

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.200
She is not seriously injured, is she?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.660
I heard about her, and I could not
sleep because I was worried.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.320
Who would do something so evil?

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.810
Did they catch the culprit?

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.040
The culprit...

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.050
was caught on scene.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.470
Prince Gyeongseong captured the culprit

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.360
and is trying to find out who was behind it.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.540
That is such a relief.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:42.100
Did they happen to find out who was behind it?

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.900
They are suspecting someone,

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.040
however, they have not yet
caught the real culprit.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.160
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong...

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.740
will find out.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.930
Do you have something to say to me

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.240
No, I do not.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.970
I hope I did not interrupt you
while you were busy.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.320
Not at all.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.790
I will put everything on hold at the store today

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.140
and visit Lady Sun Chaek with tea and snacks.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.750
Maiden Sun Chaek?

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.570
Yes.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.980
I would like to comfort her.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.720
Would you like to come with me?

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.350
I will bring snacks for Lady Sun Chaek.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.670
Please wait here for a moment.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.160
I brewed this tea myself.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.480
I will enjoy it.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.880
Take your time preparing.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.020
This is how Maiden Eun Ae is.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.320
What am I imagining?

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.980
So, this is where Maiden Eun Ae works.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:36.550
As expected of Maiden Eun Ae, it is subtle, clean,

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.740
and understated-

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.150
Sir, I am ready to go-

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.800
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:19.330
Someone copied my handwriting very well.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.580
They must know me very well.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.010
Who could it be?

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.360
This is a special paper...

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.950
that was created by dehydration
and mixed with other materials.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.820
People who would do something like this

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.200
must be no other than the Heuksa Clan.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.760
This is different than their usual behavior.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.680
I need to find out where
this paper was first distributed.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.450
- What do we do, My Lady...
- I hope she recovers quickly.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.850
- What happened?
- She needs to eat something.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.780
We do not know what would happen.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.430
Her symptoms say she is weak
and has poor blood circulation.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.470
She must rest for now.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.390
She also must take the medicine without fail.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.170
Yes.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:29.140
Thank you.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.980
Thank you.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.040
I will see him off. You stay here.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:45.340
<i>My Lady, Lady Eun Ae is here.</i>

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.880
My Lady.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.000
Lady Eun Ae.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.090
You are okay.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.430
You are not injured, are you?

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.360
Can't believe you were kidnapped.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.860
I was so shocked that I could not sleep.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.110
Thank you for worrying.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.180
I will do my best to protect you from now on.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.650
I brought you tea that will help you relax.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.870
Brew the tea.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.260
Pardon?

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.720
Oh, yes.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.580
My Lady, your wound...

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.940
Hold on.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.220
I brought you an ointment for wounds.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.470
Do not fall for me too much.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:33:00.780
By the way, what happened to the culprit?

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.590
Prince Gyeongseong captured him,

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.760
but I don't know what happened afterward.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.740
Maybe someone was behind it.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.820
The rumor already spread in the market.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.010
Someone who could plan such a thing

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.100
has to be only one person.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.540
Do you mean Do Hwa Seon?

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.340
Yes. Make sure she cannot
get away with it this time.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.290
How about you report to the
Royal Investigation Bureau?

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.790
I have Prince Gyeongseong, who is scarier
than the Royal Investigation Bureau.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.910
By the way,

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.080
you look angrier than I am.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.950
Because I consider your business as mine.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.940
<i>The special paper you mentioned
is manufactured in only one place.</i>

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.260
Let me ask you something.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.830
The special paper...

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.650
was sent to China as a tribute last year.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.990
Since then, we no longer produce it.

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:17.610
Is that so?

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:22.480
It seems many people are
looking for it these days.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.790
Did someone else look for it?

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:29.630
People from the biggest merchandise
store in Hanyang came recently.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.180
Do you mean Cho Byeong Mu's Merchandise Store?

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.530
Someone who used to work at that store

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.830
worked here at the Paper Production Agency.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.540
He had tons of special paper in his room.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.860
Cho's Merchandise Store bought all of it.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.310
Cho's Merchandise Store?

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.850
My Lord.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.930
You have been summoned to the Palace immediately.

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:54.480
Thank you.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.660
I have not yet been acknowledged by China.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.510
What do you think the reason is?

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.170
I do not know how to say this, but...

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.930
It is okay.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.480
Tell me.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.460
Everything in the world is
about trade, Your Majesty.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.350
Trade?

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.380
The Emperor is not interested
in this country at all.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.460
You cannot get what you want from
someone who is not interested.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.970
I think a bait that could interest him is needed.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.230
- If you are uncomfortable-
- No.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.650
It's okay.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.890
No one has ever told me anything like this before.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.320
Securing people's support comes first.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.400
<i>Our relationship with China is important,</i>

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.600
<i>but securing people's support comes first.</i>

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.140
They only said something so obvious.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.410
The people's support is not tangible.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.320
It is easily swept away in the wind.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.240
If a major path is determined,

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.910
everyone will end up following it.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:07.270
It sounds like you have a good solution.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.480
So, did you mention a bait earlier?

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.950
If you will allow me to do so,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.810
I will help you set the foundation.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.160
Did you rescue your fiancée successfully?

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.830
Why do you glare at me like that?

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:46.330
You are acting as if I hurt your fiancée.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.200
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.940
<i>Prince Gyeongseong is here.</i>

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.780
Let him in.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.270
I heard there was a huge ruckus last night.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.580
You summoned all soldiers in the capital?

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.120
My apologies, Your Majesty.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.020
Was it related to the Heuksa Clan?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.360
Or...

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.410
did you summon the army to find your fiancée?

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.860
I do not have any excuses to make.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.600
I did give you the right to use the military force,

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.930
but you used my soldiers for personal use.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.990
Do you consider yourself the king by chance?

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.050
That is not the case at all.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.690
The old sayings are never wrong.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.470
They say you cannot see right under your nose.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.560
I did not know a traitor would be right by my side.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.580
My loyalty to Your Majesty remains unchanged.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.290
Please listen to my plea.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.460
I will gladly accept any punishment.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.590
You will gladly accept any punishment?

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.860
No matter what it might be?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.500
<i>S-Spare him.</i>

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.720
<i>I will do anything you want me to do, Uncle.</i>

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.730
<i>No matter what that might be?</i>

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.720
<i>Can you swing that sword for me?</i>

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.550
This is my hit list.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.710
Your unchanging loyalty.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.390
Go ahead and prove it.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:10.620
If you leave now, you will arrive
tomorrow morning.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.750
Take care of it now.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:53.390
I did not say anything.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.310
Do not worry.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.340
I will make sure...

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.910
to succeed next time.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.290
You are in bad shape.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.940
Take this.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.890
I...

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.040
do not need more money.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:21.440
You have been so generous to a servant like me.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:26.780
I did it to return the favor.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.020
But still, take it.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.870
You need to run away in order
to plan for the next time.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:44.930
I knew you cared about people like me.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.890
People might show up here soon. Run now.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.370
I would be able to see you again, right?

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.600
As long as we stay alive,

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.620
I am sure we will meet again.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.840
<i>I was able to come this far on my own.</i>

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.320
<i>Actually, she is supposedly his daughter,</i>

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.050
<i>but she frequents his bedroom, apparently.</i>

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.100
<i>Oh, my.</i>

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.920
<i>Of course, you dislike me, too.</i>

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.960
<i>I am sorry. I should have known better.</i>

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.650
<i>I dare asked to befriend the minister's daughter.</i>

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.630
<i>Excuse me, Maiden Do Hwa Seon.</i>

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:49.340
<i>My name is not Do Hwa Seon.</i>

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.310
<i>My name is Cho Eun Ae.</i>

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.320
<i>Lady Eun Ae?</i>

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.170
<i>Wasn't she at the plague village?</i>

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.680
<i>M-My Lady.</i>

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.810
<i>Nothing is predetermined in this world.</i>

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.930
<i>- Your Highness.
- Keep massaging her.</i>

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.330
<i>Your Highness. Your Highness.</i>

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.100
Everything went wrong because
of you, Cha Sun Chaek.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.570
<i>Buying a fake nobility note</i>

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.300
<i>cannot change one's fate, I suppose.</i>

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.730
Fate changes.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.360
An abandoned orphan on the streets

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.080
grew a successful store and
even became a noblewoman.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.110
I cannot be satisfied now.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:17.640
I will get rid of anyone who gets in my way.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.670
You could not even do that properly.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.540
Pathetic bastard.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.770
My goodness.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.470
Did I see something I was not supposed to?

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.330
You are...

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.140
It was a good try,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.030
but you are still clumsy.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.370
You missed the vital spot.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:00.460
Should I finish him off for you?

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:04.000
Do not worry.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.860
I will keep this a secret.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.830
What do you want from me?

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:17.150
Similar people recognize each other.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.980
Perhaps we share the same goal.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.650
You want to change the world, too.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.700
What are you talking about?

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.090
No need to try to act in front of me.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.720
If you are quick,

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.590
you must have understood me immediately.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.940
Let us not waste each other's time.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.640
Would you like to work with me?

00:46:11.337 --> 00:46:13.277
Mother.

00:46:13.277 --> 00:46:14.297
How is this one?

00:46:14.297 --> 00:46:15.777
Yes, that is nice.

00:46:15.777 --> 00:46:17.227
Nice.

00:46:18.747 --> 00:46:20.807
How pretty.

00:46:24.297 --> 00:46:25.977
Mother, what is that?

00:46:25.977 --> 00:46:28.617
We can let the servants do other things,

00:46:28.617 --> 00:46:32.297
but I wanted to embroider
the newlyweds' bedding myself.

00:46:32.297 --> 00:46:34.807
Why have you been hiding a talent like this?

00:46:34.807 --> 00:46:38.577
I had no opportunity to use my talent.

00:46:38.577 --> 00:46:44.447
Your grandmother used to
do embroidery herself as well.

00:46:44.447 --> 00:46:48.827
I guess she wanted you to
live happily ever after.

00:46:48.827 --> 00:46:51.967
You must have become happier
after getting married.

00:46:51.967 --> 00:46:56.087
Getting married does not always bring happiness.

00:46:56.087 --> 00:46:58.647
- Pardon?
- Marriage means...

00:46:58.647 --> 00:47:02.117
going through things with
your spouse and your children

00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:04.447
and creating the new future

00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:07.367
while facing hardships from time to time.

00:47:07.367 --> 00:47:10.957
Happiness follows in the process.

00:47:10.957 --> 00:47:14.157
Nothing is predetermined.

00:47:14.157 --> 00:47:16.077
Then, the process of

00:47:16.077 --> 00:47:19.357
putting the efforts with Prince Gyeongseong
must be important.

00:47:19.357 --> 00:47:23.357
I want to make Prince Gyeongseong happy.

00:47:23.357 --> 00:47:25.357
What should I do?

00:47:25.357 --> 00:47:29.717
You are so determined, Sun Chaek.

00:47:29.717 --> 00:47:33.287
You could finish the bridal training quickly, too.

00:47:33.287 --> 00:47:35.277
Bridal training?

00:47:35.277 --> 00:47:39.067
So you could survive better
than anyone after getting married,

00:47:39.067 --> 00:47:42.477
I'll share my tips with you thoroughly.

00:47:42.477 --> 00:47:44.307
Brace yourself.

00:47:45.307 --> 00:47:47.517
Mother...

00:47:51.087 --> 00:47:55.457
There is something I would
like you to do beforehand.

00:47:56.747 --> 00:47:58.597
What is it?

00:48:11.437 --> 00:48:15.957
<i>Is there a reason you are revisiting the past?</i>

00:48:15.957 --> 00:48:19.787
He was the former king's favorite prime minister.

00:48:19.787 --> 00:48:25.477
He is apparently more respected
than the local governor there.

00:48:25.477 --> 00:48:28.397
<i>It is time to get rid of the
source of future troubles.</i>

00:48:29.287 --> 00:48:32.367
Who are you?

00:48:56.297 --> 00:48:58.857
Is it His Majesty's order?

00:48:59.747 --> 00:49:05.257
Will His Majesty's bloodbath start again?

00:49:05.257 --> 00:49:10.397
I am just someone who follows the King's order.

00:49:10.397 --> 00:49:12.327
I will die as he wishes.

00:49:12.327 --> 00:49:16.457
Just give me some time, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:49:16.457 --> 00:49:20.527
You know that I cannot do that.

00:49:20.527 --> 00:49:25.597
Tomorrow is my youngest daughter's wedding day.

00:49:25.597 --> 00:49:30.717
I cannot let her have her father's
funeral before a celebration.

00:49:31.787 --> 00:49:33.617
I beg you.

00:50:28.937 --> 00:50:30.877
So, this is the place.

00:50:32.827 --> 00:50:36.767
<i>Before weddings, my parents always</i>

00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:39.897
visited the temple to pray.

00:50:39.897 --> 00:50:45.367
Offer a devout prayer for a good
marriage to Prince Gyeongseong.

00:50:48.237 --> 00:50:50.287
My Lady,

00:50:50.287 --> 00:50:52.387
while you are praying,

00:50:52.387 --> 00:50:55.337
I will run an errand for Madam quickly.

00:50:55.337 --> 00:50:56.517
Sure.

00:50:59.257 --> 00:51:01.307
Yes.

00:51:01.307 --> 00:51:04.017
Think of it as a Templestay.

00:51:21.187 --> 00:51:23.257
Prince Seonghyeon?

00:51:23.257 --> 00:51:27.017
Why is he standing there getting all wet?

00:51:36.697 --> 00:51:39.547
What are you doing here?

00:51:41.147 --> 00:51:43.787
You'll catch a cold. Come this way.

00:51:43.787 --> 00:51:45.037
Hurry.

00:51:54.677 --> 00:51:58.507
See? You already caught a cold.

00:51:58.507 --> 00:52:02.247
Why were you foolishly standing in the rain?

00:52:06.927 --> 00:52:09.417
Standing in the rain...

00:52:09.417 --> 00:52:12.957
makes it feel like old wounds
are getting washed away.

00:52:12.957 --> 00:52:14.927
Wounds?

00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:18.177
When I left Hanyang, I had my parents'

00:52:19.517 --> 00:52:21.657
memorial service at this temple.

00:52:22.607 --> 00:52:25.887
I was greeting them after being away for 10 years.

00:52:27.587 --> 00:52:31.077
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

00:52:32.377 --> 00:52:34.347
It is okay.

00:52:34.347 --> 00:52:36.957
You make me feel less lonely.

00:52:39.587 --> 00:52:42.117
Are you sure you're okay?

00:52:47.957 --> 00:52:52.337
Being here reminds me of that day.

00:52:52.337 --> 00:52:53.597
That day?

00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:57.467
You fell in the study
at our house, and I saved you.

00:52:57.467 --> 00:53:01.837
We ended up falling together, and you got injured.

00:53:01.837 --> 00:53:04.397
Where did you get hurt back then?

00:53:05.397 --> 00:53:08.957
Was it m-my head?

00:53:10.647 --> 00:53:14.547
No, was it my leg?

00:53:16.077 --> 00:53:18.717
Are you really Sun Chaek?

00:53:28.117 --> 00:53:30.927
It was too long ago.

00:53:34.697 --> 00:53:39.077
Looking at your puzzled look, you are Sun Chaek.

00:53:39.077 --> 00:53:41.417
I was joking. I was joking.

00:53:45.897 --> 00:53:47.727
Goodness...

00:53:49.217 --> 00:53:50.567
What are you doing?

00:53:50.567 --> 00:53:53.447
I would like to take a short nap.

00:53:53.447 --> 00:53:56.687
I have not been able to sleep for three days.

00:53:56.687 --> 00:53:59.307
It will only take a moment.

00:53:59.307 --> 00:54:01.657
Just until it stops raining.

00:54:02.667 --> 00:54:07.547
<i>Cha Sun Chaek and Yi Gyu must've
been closer than I thought.</i>

00:54:07.547 --> 00:54:09.937
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:54:28.307 --> 00:54:30.147
Are you awake?

00:54:33.107 --> 00:54:35.037
Look at this.

00:54:35.037 --> 00:54:37.417
It's a puppy.

00:54:38.457 --> 00:54:40.157
So cute.

00:54:40.157 --> 00:54:41.517
Where did you come from?

00:54:41.517 --> 00:54:43.587
He was lost and totally wet.

00:54:43.587 --> 00:54:45.607
I found him nearby.

00:54:46.427 --> 00:54:49.327
What do we do? I think he lost his mom.

00:54:49.327 --> 00:54:52.537
I think I will have to keep you.

00:54:52.537 --> 00:54:56.507
I cannot bring myself to leave you behind.

00:54:57.447 --> 00:54:58.667
Could you give him a name?

00:54:58.667 --> 00:55:00.887
- Me?
- Yes.

00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:10.557
- Is it a person? A person is dead?
- A person is dead.

00:55:12.607 --> 00:55:14.087
How did he end up dying?

00:55:14.087 --> 00:55:16.467
- What's going on?
- I wonder.

00:55:16.467 --> 00:55:19.787
- What's that?
- Let us check it out.

00:55:26.747 --> 00:55:29.587
<i>My goodness! Look.</i>

00:55:41.827 --> 00:55:44.067
You should not have seen that.

00:55:44.067 --> 00:55:45.927
It is okay.

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:48.987
It is okay.

00:55:56.397 --> 00:55:58.477
What are you doing right now?

00:55:59.557 --> 00:56:01.827
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

00:56:13.877 --> 00:56:15.597
There is...

00:56:16.697 --> 00:56:20.627
There is the body of my kidnapper.

00:56:33.137 --> 00:56:35.137
It is okay.

00:56:35.137 --> 00:56:37.137
I am here now.

00:56:40.087 --> 00:56:43.877
This country obviously has the Ministry of Justice.

00:56:45.037 --> 00:56:47.757
If one condemns another personally,

00:56:48.687 --> 00:56:51.187
what would be the use of the law?

00:57:10.067 --> 00:57:12.557
Sun Chaek looks very shocked.

00:57:13.327 --> 00:57:15.297
Provide comfort for her.

00:57:39.937 --> 00:57:43.237
I am all right.

00:57:46.687 --> 00:57:48.447
Thank you.

00:57:59.737 --> 00:58:01.527
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:58:04.917 --> 00:58:09.727
What Prince Seonghyeon said earlier...

00:58:14.887 --> 00:58:16.857
Prince Seonghyeon, Yi Gyu...

00:58:16.857 --> 00:58:21.007
You cannot be close to him, no matter what.

00:58:21.007 --> 00:58:23.487
He holds a grudge against me.

00:58:23.487 --> 00:58:26.317
What kind of grudge?

00:58:32.487 --> 00:58:37.387
I do not want you to incur any more grievances.

00:58:38.387 --> 00:58:39.757
What does that mean?

00:58:39.757 --> 00:58:42.827
It means I don't want you to kill people.

00:58:43.917 --> 00:58:45.457
By chance,

00:58:46.367 --> 00:58:48.327
do you believe what Prince Seonghyeon said?

00:58:48.327 --> 00:58:50.697
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:58:54.747 --> 00:58:57.077
Do you not trust me?

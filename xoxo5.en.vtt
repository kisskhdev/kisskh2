WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
<i>You're really the whole package.</i>

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.760
Beautiful and delicious.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.200
<i>The same old thing again?</i>
<i>She asked when you're getting married?</i>

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.480
Mm, I…

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.680
Who's this?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.920
This is Tonnam. She's my roommate.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.520
- Can I sit with you, please?
<i>- Hey, have you met the new professor yet?</i>

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
Let me introduce her to you.
She'll be joining our department.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.560
Then let's raise a glass
to welcome our new colleague!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.400
But I still don't know how you feel

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.760
<i>after that night you…</i>

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.400
I like you.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.520
This is the very store that
caused my dad's death.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.840
She took me biking
to this construction site.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.000
At first, I was confused, like,
where are we going?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.240
When we got there,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.240
I was like,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.280
how could it open here?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.240
Then she told me

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
this caused her dad's death.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.880
My whole body just froze.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.680
I couldn't say a word.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.320
I get how you feel.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.640
If she knows it's your family business,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.560
boom!

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.240
But if she finds out later,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280
boom again!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.800
Seriously, what should I do?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.600
I've been thinking about it
day and night for days.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.720
I have no clue.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.480
S stands for "strengths."

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.920
What gives your business the edge?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.520
How are your products
and services different?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.760
Do you have any special skills
or knowledge?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.680
Easy to understand, easy to access.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.000
No competitors.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120
But being the only one
doesn't mean people will buy.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.440
Next, W. Weaknesses.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.200
What puts us at a disadvantage?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.080
New brand.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.000
Owner's emotionally distant.
No idea what she's even thinking.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.320
Maybe it's her background.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.160
Then there's O. Opportunities.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.520
External factors
that could help us succeed.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.280
Trends, government policies, social media.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.040
60%.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.880
I'm not sure how I feel about you.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.680
So, now do you know?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.640
I like you.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.280
80%.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.800
Okay. Last one.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.200
T. Threats.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.240
Forecast negative impacts
from external factors,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.320
both direct and indirect.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.000
Mouse Mart.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.200
Professors, please help assess the risk.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.600
Should I tell her about Mouse Mart or not?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.360
Risk of not telling?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.600
50%.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.960
If you don't tell her now,
you may as well never.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.200
Just wait and see
if she finds out on her own.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.000
But I believe secrets don't stay secret.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.440
100% this business crashes
if she finds out later.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.960
But how do we define "later"?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.520
One day? Two days?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.960
That counts as "later," right?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.160
What defines the line for "knowing later"?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
Probably if you had the chance
to tell but didn't,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.720
anything after would count as "later."

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.800
Hey, where are you going?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.280
I'll be right back.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.360
MOUSE MART IS COMING SOON
WITH SPECIAL PROMOTIONS!

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.160
Coming soon? When's that supposed to be?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.080
What are you looking at there?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.920
Oh, I just came to see
how far along the shop is.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.320
I see.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.760
- Do you want to take a look inside?
- No, thanks. I appreciate it.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.320
Um… I brought this for you.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.960
I didn't order anything.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.400
Maybe a worker did?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.040
No, I just noticed you buy them often,
so this is a little gift from me.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.680
Please take it. It's on the house.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.160
Thanks.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.520
So, when's "coming soon"?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.280
It should be ready
by the end of the month.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.200
Drop by if you have time.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.640
I'll give you a discount.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.240
Sure. Thanks a lot.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.080
Good luck with your work.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160
Sure. Thank you.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.040
STORE DESIGN AND DECORATION LOCATION
MOUSE MART, BRANCH 001235

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.720
Ugh! End of the month?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.000
That's like a doctor saying,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.920
"Sorry, you've got one month left."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.560
Ugh, I'm freaking out.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.960
Who's dying?

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.080
No one, except maybe me.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.720
Seriously, I'm losing it.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.840
Do you want some coffee?
I brought you one.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.720
Nope. Just looking at it gives me chills.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.720
From now on,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.560
I'm never buying or using anything
from Mouse Mart again.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640
What?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.560
You used to go there all the time.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.480
When you were too lazy to go out,
you even had stuff delivered.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.920
That was then.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.800
Now they're opening right here.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.400
You know they're the reason my dad died.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.920
Okay, okay.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.120
Then I won't drink it either.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.680
But actually, I came because
I've got something big to tell you.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.680
YUTH PANICH

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.080
Wan, are you okay?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.960
My friend just came by and said…

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.520
So these are your assets.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.320
And this is your debt.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.160
You don't have to read it. I'll summarize.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.640
You're in debt. 450,000.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.200
Legally, you're the sole heir,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.800
which means you inherit the debt too.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.920
Debt is a kind of inheritance.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
450,000? Seriously?
I don't even have 100,000.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.560
Take a breath.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.960
You don't have to pay it all at once.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.400
I did the math.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.520
Your dad mortgaged the house,
this grocery store.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.320
He got 2 million,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.640
and more than half is already paid back.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.880
If you pay the bank 30,000 a month,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.160
then in 24 months,
just two years, it's done.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.360
Hey.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.760
It's just two years. It's not too bad.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.760
If I had a full-time job,
maybe it'd be possible.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.080
But right now,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.040
I'm barely making half a regular salary
from selling stuff.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.360
What if I pay 15,000 a month?

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.040
Then it'd take 6 years.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.760
Six years?! Wasn't it two before?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.040
If I pay half, shouldn't it be four years?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.880
No, you can't think like that.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.320
This isn't borrowing from a friend.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.320
Interest is brutal, you know.
Don't you know the saying?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.640
"Bought a house for two million, ended up
paying four to five with interest."

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.040
Compound interest is like a snowball.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.080
Ugh, it's all because of that
stupid Mouse Mart.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.200
It's opening at the end of the month.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.400
Once it's here,
my sales will drop for sure.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.760
I don't even know
when Dad mortgaged the shop.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.400
But if I miss a payment, they'll take it.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.560
Even now, just selling
to make debt payments is already hard.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.040
There's food, bills…

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.560
and now Mouse Mart is right next door.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.120
Honestly, I don't think
I can last six months if this keeps up.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.600
<i>Risk of not telling?</i>

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.080
50%.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.640
If you don't tell her now,
you may as well never.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.880
Just wait and see
if she finds out on her own.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.080
Why open here of all places?!

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.800
It's like they're trying to kill me!

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.200
I'm sorry.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.640
I got stressed.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.400
I'm just scared I'll be the reason
my dad's business fails.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.960
Don't say that, Wan.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.240
You're doing great.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.400
Every problem has a solution.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.720
I'll help you.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.840
Thank you.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.760
- Whoa.
- Hold this for me. It's super heavy.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.720
What did you buy so much stuff for?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.200
So I still couldn't
bring myself to tell her.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.880
Eh? Why not?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.360
The timing was just not right.
Like, it was really wrong.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.560
How so?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.280
Where's Chompoo?
I'll just wait and tell both of you.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.840
She's not here.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.920
Eh? You two are already done
with the exams?

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.960
The new professor called her,
asking for help prepping next term.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.760
Chompoo's been cozying up to her,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.360
scared she'll tell Tik about us.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.680
Now it's like, she calls, she runs.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.160
She snaps, she jumps.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.320
And what's with all this food?

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.320
Three people can't eat this much.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.960
Come on. It's not just for us.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.880
I wanted to support Wan,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.720
and I'll give the rest
to students tomorrow before the exam.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.360
Okay, but let me vent a little more.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.520
I just don't get it.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.600
Why'd she call now of all times?

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.760
This is supposed to be our personal time.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.440
At first, she didn't even want to go.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.640
She was whining about
how fierce and snobby she seemed.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.240
And look at her now.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.640
Thanks.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.080
Girl, calm down.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.880
The snack didn't do anything wrong.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.440
It's okay. Let's just switch bags.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.120
Let's just switch bags.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.080
Right.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.400
That face says, "I don't like you," huh?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.280
Maybe they're just gossiping.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.520
Stay positive.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.200
I'm going to wash my hands.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.480
Calm down. Positive thinking.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.440
Can I help you?

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.680
Is your family the owner of Mouse Mart?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.040
Why do you ask?

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.760
I'm just surprised
you're still working here as a professor.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.880
I'm not saying
people can't do lots of things,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.720
but I imagine things must
be hectic on your side.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:39.000
Well, it's my family's business, not mine.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.360
Can I help you with something?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.920
I'm looking for funding
for a research project.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.160
It's about key factors
influencing visits to convenience stores.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.320
Prof. Chompoo said I could ask you.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.240
I've got a lot on my plate right now,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.440
finalizing my PhD thesis topic and all.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.520
I don't think I have time to help.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.360
I'm sorry.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.600
That's okay.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.440
I'll ask Prof. Chompoo like before.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.800
EXAM: ACCOUNTING THEORY 3(03)
50 QUESTIONS IN TOTAL

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.640
Babe, I'm sorry
I didn't do the dishes this morning.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.280
I had to leave in a rush.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.760
What time's the exam?

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.640
Are you okay?

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.960
I'm not okay.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.880
Are you really only doing all this
so she won't talk about us?

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.680
You didn't even like her at first.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.320
- Now you're suddenly close?
- Wait.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.520
Are you mad about this?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.480
Do you know why I'm doing this?

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.360
It's to protect our relationship.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.640
Really?

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.280
I always thought protecting a relationship
means telling the truth

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.760
when you have the chance.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.520
Your family's cool with us.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.000
You don't understand what it's like
to have a family that isn't.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.680
Try putting yourself in my shoes for once.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.600
Hey, don't let this blow up.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.120
Do you get that--

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.800
Students, please take a seat.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.240
Sit anywhere you'd like.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.760
Don't be surprised.
Those snacks are from me.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.240
Acting like you two were fighting?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.080
Nope.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.560
Exam's in ten minutes.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.120
Call your friends.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.800
Ugh, I didn't even finish selling these,
and now they're expired.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.000
Another loss.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.040
Ew, this one's moldy.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.720
Why'd they go bad so fast?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.280
- Thank you. It's okay.
- No problem. Here, let me help.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.800
Thanks again.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.600
- Just hang it here, right?
- Yes, thanks.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.160
What can I get you today?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.040
Fresh delivery just came in.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.000
We have pandan filling,
golden egg yolk threads,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.680
strawberry, and taro fillings too.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.160
Or do you want to try this one?
It's khanom ping.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.440
Try one first.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.560
If you like it, great.
If not, no pressure.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.720
Here you go.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.480
How is it? Do you like it?

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.480
I do.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.120
Do you want to buy one?

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.400
I'll get you a new jar. Here you go.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.240
That'll be 500 baht.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.160
Here you go.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.280
Thanks a lot.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.599
Keep the change.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.319
It's just a small thank-you for the drinks
you brought me the other day.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.920
Are you sure?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.160
That's too generous.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.520
- Wait--
- It's okay, really. No change.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.839
Thank you so much.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.720
What time do you normally close?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.000
Usually around nine in the evening.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.960
But if you're coming, just call.
I'll wait for you.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.320
Yes. Thanks.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.240
Whoa, just a few sales
and I've already hit 1,000!

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.160
Money flowing in! Luck's pouring down!

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.680
Wan!

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.880
Today's exam day,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.880
so I made one for you too.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.040
If you hand this in, that's effort points.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.680
But…

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.200
I'm not giving you full marks just yet.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.960
I'll try harder from now on, Teacher Wan.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.200
You got this, Miss Maewnam.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.200
But hey, I didn't just come here to whine.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.360
I'm here to shop, buying snacks
to give the other professors.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.040
Sure. What would you like?

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.440
Maybe I'll just buy the whole store?

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.320
Wait, really?!

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.480
I don't have money.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.560
Well then, just grab what you want.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.320
- Grab what you want.
- Wait, free?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600
We'll settle up later.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.520
These are for you, Tik.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.320
Such a generous soul.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.440
Thanks, Maewnam.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.440
I bought a bunch for students
and had some left.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.680
Fine. I'm taking it anyway.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.640
Thank you.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.120
But I bought this just for you,
Prof. Mahnmook.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.120
Thank you.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.720
About the research,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.640
you can ask me directly.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.840
No need to go through Prof. Chompoo.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.200
I'll help.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.120
You have time now?

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.520
Well…

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.520
I think your topic is something
I can help with better.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.160
Then thank you.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.880
Okay, everyone's here.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.840
Girls, I want to invite all of you
to stay after class.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.560
Let's go find something really good
and delicious to eat together.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.080
Let's celebrate finishing exams,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.520
and we'll also use it as a chance
to welcome Prof. Mahnmook.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.360
But no flaking!

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.720
If anyone bails, I'm adding
an extra morning class to your schedule.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.320
Now pack it up. Hurry up.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.200
Yummy.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.280
I'm sorry. I got lost on the way.
I took a huge detour.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.200
Oh, no worries. You're here now.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.400
I already ordered tamarind shrimp,
stir-fried bitter melon with egg,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.720
and the star,
banana blossom chicken curry.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.680
Banana what?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.520
Eh? You've never heard of it?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.600
It's just unripe banana.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.320
- Ah, got it.
- Hungry? I'll get you a menu.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.000
Hey, can we get a menu please?

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.920
Just order anything you like.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.080
It's all good.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.760
No, it's okay.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.120
It's fine. Don't worry.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.240
Thanks.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.360
You should've told her
you couldn't eat it.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280
It's fine.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.240
Are you allergic to shrimp?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I'll just take an antihistamine.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.240
See? That's what you're always doing.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.880
You're always putting up with it.
You keep tolerating nonsense.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.480
And you end up hurting yourself.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.000
Calm down.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.640
It's not a big deal.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.400
Why make it into one?

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.600
And you snapping at everyone,
is that fair?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.280
Hey.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.720
Have you ever stopped
and asked yourself why I'm upset?

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.600
Then you ask yourself
why I keep putting up with stuff.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.480
Tolerating doesn't mean I'm not trying.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.520
Ugh… can we go one day without fighting?

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.240
I'm sorry. I think I should go, Tik.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.320
Oh?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.400
Well, are we still eating or not?

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.520
Here, help finish the shrimp.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.240
- Sure. I think four dishes are plenty.
- No need to order more, right?

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.800
YUTH PANICH

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.440
Wan!

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.520
I thought you weren't coming.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.800
Were you waiting?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.360
No. Didn't you see?
I'm just about to close up.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.120
Geez, today was the last exam
I had to proctor.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.480
It was total chaos. I was drained.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.560
At first I thought
the store was already closed,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.240
but I saw it was still open,
so I ran right over.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.880
To see me?

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240
To buy ice cream.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.040
Someone's smiling.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.360
I'm here to buy ice cream and see you.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040
What's up, Wan?

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.760
Long time no see.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.360
Oh? You two know each other?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.720
How do you two know each other?

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.800
Oh, this is Prof. Mahnmook.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.360
She's new at the department.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.400
We had a faculty dinner earlier,
and I got a ride with her.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.000
Aren't you going to answer her question?

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.400
How did we know each other?

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.640
Old friend.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.200
Two ice creams, right?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.800
Do you want anything else?

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.440
Can I use your bathroom?

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.920
Can you show me where it is?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.520
I'm sorry about your dad.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.640
I just found out,
so I didn't make it to the funeral.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.240
Are you into Prof. Maewnam or something?

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.880
So why didn't you tell her what we were?

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.960
Are you worried she'll overthink it?

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.640
So you're in the talking stage then?

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.200
After you're done,
don't forget to turn off the light.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.840
Actually, dating Mouse Mart's
owner's daughter,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.840
there was no need to open
your own grocery store.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.640
What did you just say?

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.080
I'm heading out.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.160
Why are you even shopping here?

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.280
Why not Mouse Mart?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.200
You're their daughter.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.400
How do you know that?

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.320
Why didn't you tell me?

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.440
I…

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.240
I wasn't trying to hide it.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.040
I was going to tell you yesterday.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.440
Remember when I biked over
and bought a bunch of stuff?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.280
But when I found out you were in debt,
hundreds of thousands,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.160
I didn't want to make it worse.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.800
So I was waiting for a better moment.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.360
I'm…

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.040
I'm not making excuses.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.720
I really care about you.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.320
That's the truth.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.440
You know how I feel
about Mouse Mart, right?

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.160
I do.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.800
Then why didn't you tell me that day?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.480
This is the very store that
caused my dad's death.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.440
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.600
<i>I'm sleeping at home tonight.</i>

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.440
GROCERY VS CONVENIENCE STORE

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.200
A CONVENIENCE STORE WITH A MOUSE LOGO JUST
OPENED NEARBY, AND EVERYONE'S GOING THERE.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.520
SAD, REALLY.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.640
CAPITALISM ONLY FAVORS THE RICH.
IT EXPLOITS PEOPLE LIKE US.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.080
Why does it have to be this way?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.920
<i>You know</i>

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.640
how I feel about Mouse Mart, right?

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.960
Then why didn't you tell me that day?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.280
YUTH PANICH

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.880
<i>Wan, I don't want to bother you</i>
<i>when you need time to think.</i>

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.480
<i>But I don't want to disappear to the point</i>

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.160
<i>where it feels like</i>
<i>I'm not even here anymore.</i>

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.800
<i>I just want you to feel like</i>
<i>I'm still here.</i>

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.600
<i>Maewnam.</i>

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.960
<i>P.S. If anything breaks,</i>
<i>call me like always, okay?</i>

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.920
<i>If anything breaks,</i>
<i>call me like always, okay?</i>

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.200
MAEWNAM

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.280
I'd like to buy something. Is anyone here?

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.440
Coming!

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.040
I'm sorry. I was in the middle
of a fight with the faucet.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.600
The faucet's broken?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.480
Just a little. It keeps dripping
even when I turn it off.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.320
Do you want me to take a look?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.000
Well…

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.400
You can turn on the water pump now.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.240
Okay, give me a sec.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.960
How is it?

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.080
All done.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.440
Thank you so much. How much do I owe you?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.560
Oh, don't worry.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.760
It wasn't a big deal.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.240
Then… just a sec.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.080
Here. I see you come here often for these.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.120
You can share these
with the other workers too.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.880
Thank you.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.000
I thought you'd stop by last night.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.360
Ah, it was one of the workers' birthdays.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.880
We ended up drinking a bit
and it went on for a long time.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.480
I didn't think you'd be waiting.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.560
Then I'll come by tonight.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.920
Okay. Only if it's convenient for you.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.720
I'll step out for now then.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.760
Sure.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.760
Professor.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.080
Can I talk to you for a minute?

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.720
Did you tell Wan about me?

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.960
About you?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.480
About what?

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.840
That I'm the daughter of
Mouse Mart's owner.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.080
Wait.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.520
She didn't know yet?

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.320
I thought she already did.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.920
No. I haven't told her.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.360
I kind of figured
you two had something going on,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.679
so I just said, "That's great."

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.560
"Her family is the owner of Mouse Mart."

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.440
"You must have great advice
for your grocery store."

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:43.639
I assumed you two shared everything.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.480
Wan's the kind of person
who hates anything insincere.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.960
It makes her feel lied to.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:00.320
You really seem like a friend

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.760
who knows her well.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.520
Nope.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.880
Not just friends.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.480
I handled the problem the wrong way.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.720
I cared too much about others.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.840
I hate how we don't talk like this.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.760
I even bought this to apologize
without caring what others might think.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.680
Aren't you going to say something?

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.280
Hi, Tik.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.040
Why did you tease me?

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.360
I wanted to see if hearing that name
would make you drop the act.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.280
You see it now?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.440
When I went home,

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.520
and had time to think alone…

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.920
<i>In a relationship, nothing ever ends</i>
<i>in complete disappointment</i>

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.920
<i>or goes exactly 100% as we hope.</i>

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.200
<i>Something that feels easy for us</i>

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.600
<i>might be the hardest thing</i>
<i>for someone else.</i>

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.440
<i>Think about it once again.</i>

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.720
<i>Are we placing our expectations</i>

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.680
<i>on someone we love</i>
<i>and asking them to carry them for us?</i>

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.000
I understand you better now.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.480
I know you've been trying hard.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.080
I just don't want to be a source
of stress in your life anymore.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.880
And about us…

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.920
If you're not ready to tell your mom,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.680
then don't.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.080
Just being together right now
is good enough for us.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.160
Then from now on,
I'm going to stand my ground more.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.240
Starting with you.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080
Stand up.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.560
Come closer.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.880
Closer.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.520
You're doing this here?

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.200
Aren't you afraid someone might see?

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.000
I'm blocking the view.

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.800
There's a CCTV camera.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.200
You're doing this, huh?

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.760
She's probably not coming anymore.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.480
You're closing up already?

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.120
Not yet. Come on in.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.040
We've got fresh snacks this evening.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.920
Actually, I didn't come to order anything.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.680
But…

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.600
I brought something for you.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.680
Oh? What?

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.880
Flowers.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.200
I searched for a flower bouquet shop,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.960
and this one makes beautiful arrangements,

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.040
so I ordered one for you.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.640
No, thank you.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.360
I…

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.800
I don't know what I'd do with them.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.800
Why would you say something like that?

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.680
Haven't you shown signs
you're interested in me?

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.480
When… did I ever show that?

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.640
Well, you gave me snacks.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.080
You brought me drinks.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.160
You kept the store open waiting for me.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.920
If that's not interest, what is it?

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.560
It's…

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.480
It's called customer service.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.560
You're a customer.
I treat you well. That's it.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.640
But I call it "throwing yourself at me."

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.480
Come on, just admit it.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.400
I actually like women
who make the first move.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.440
I wasn't throwing myself at you.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.680
Being friendly
doesn't mean I'm interested.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.040
You're not?

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.000
You smiled at me like that.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.880
You even took me to the back
of the store. Come on.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.720
Stop playing hard to get.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.680
It's just us here.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.600
Stop pretending already.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.880
Hey, let go! You creep! Let go!

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.960
- Ow! Let go!
- You creep!

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.760
- Let go!
- Shut up!

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.120
- Someone, help!
- Let go!

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.320
- Help!
- Shut up!

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.880
Hey!

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.680
Ouch!

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.840
Don't mess with my Wan!

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.520
Leave now, or I'll call the police.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.720
Go ahead. Let's see who hurt whom.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.880
But you harassed her first.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.200
We've got evidence.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.440
Call the police, Wan.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.520
Wan, are you hurt?

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.760
I'm fine.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.280
I'm so sorry I came late,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.160
so you got hurt.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.480
But you made it, didn't you?

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.680
Are you going to dock my points?

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.120
No way.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.240
You get bonus points.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.520
You're incredible, Maewnam.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.560
He flew across the room.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.200
My mom made me take Taekwondo as a kid.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.160
She said it was for self-defense.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.200
Guess I finally used it to protect you.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:57.000
At first, I didn't think
I'd see you again.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.120
Honestly, I wasn't planning to come.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.320
But there's something
I needed to talk to you about.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.720
That's why I rushed here.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.480
About Mouse Mart?

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.600
No.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.840
But if you want to talk about
that first, we can.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.360
Talk about your matter first.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.600
I know now that

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.080
Prof. Mahnmook isn't just your old friend.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.720
She's more than that.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.880
I didn't want to overthink,

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:53.520
so I came to ask you directly
what the truth is.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.480
She told you already?

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.160
You can say I'm making excuses,

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.800
but truthfully, I don't even know
if she considered me her girlfriend.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.520
I can't even say when we ever
officially got together.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.600
If you don't want to talk about it,

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.480
we don't have to.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.160
But I just want you to know that

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.080
I came to ask
because I really wanted to know.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.400
I'm not mad at you.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.520
Your answer was honest.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.560
That's more than enough for me.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.720
Ask me about Mouse Mart now.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.880
I've been thinking about it all night.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.680
After I found out,
what's the point in being mad at you?

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.880
What does it change?

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.840
I'll admit, I felt numb when I found out.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.600
But then I reminded myself

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.160
that the Maewnam I know
isn't a cunning person.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.600
Still, anger is anger.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.680
It's like someone punching you
and saying "sorry."

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.080
It still hurts at the time,
so it can't just go away instantly.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.720
I understand.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.440
And I'm sorry for not telling you
from the beginning.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.640
Once I missed the right moment,
everything just felt off.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.800
Can I ask you one more thing?

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.440
That thing you said about grocery stores--

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.480
could you say it again?

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.160
Sure.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.280
Lots of grocery stores can absolutely
stand against big convenience stores.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.680
Community-based marketing is powerful.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.520
People shop where they feel comfortable.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.200
Your store is exactly
where they feel more at ease.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.280
People prefer shopping
where they feel comfortable.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.240
Even if you just left your full-time job
and came back to this,

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.920
you've always been talented.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.440
You've always been
a talented person I like.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.720
Do you think I'm lying?

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.080
The store's almost out of stock.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.600
Do you want to go restock together?

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.080
Sure.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.520
Whoa… it's this late already?

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.920
Do you think anywhere's still open?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.560
Good point.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.920
I've got a mountain of exams to grade too.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.000
I should probably head back then.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.720
Oh, wait.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.760
I forgot to ask.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.640
Where's my score at?

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.680
Well…

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.920
When it's close to full,
I'll let you know.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.400
Sure.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.920
I'll be waiting.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.280
GRADE SUBMISSION SYSTEM

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.920
Hello? What's up, Wan?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.640
<i>Maewnam, something's wrong</i>
<i>with the CCTV at the store.</i>

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.000
<i>Can you come take a look?</i>

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.240
Sure. Just a sec.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.360
What seems to be the issue?

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.080
YOU'VE GOT FULL MARKS ALREADY

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.240
When I found out you were
the daughter of Mouse Mart's owner,

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.800
I thought I'd be really mad at you.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.000
But in the end, I wasn't.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.080
I forgave you so easily.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.480
Just like you forgave me easily

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.840
when you found out about me and Mahnmook.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.160
Now I understand something.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.800
When two people like each other enough,

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.920
things don't have to be so complicated.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:01.920
Right?

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.120
Yeah.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.400
And this is a reward
for an awesome person.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.680
YUTH PANICH UNIVERSITY
FACULTY OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.280
HEREBY GRANTS THIS DEGREE
FOR THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF STUDIES

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.920
I graduated with First-Class Honors.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.640
Maewnam.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.440
Be my girlfriend.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.400
You're so dramatic, Professor Sudteerak.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.920
And calling me here
just to "check the CCTV"?

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.160
That wasn't dramatic at all,
my beautiful grocery sister?

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.680
I really put my heart into this, you know.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.120
Didn't you like it?

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.280
You know what?

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.640
I'm someone who puts a lot of effort
into everything I do,

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.160
including this.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.640
How about staying over tonight?

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.280
Wait here for a sec.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.800
<i>Even though I haven't told Mom</i>
<i>who you are to me yet,</i>

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.440
<i>I'm going to show her.</i>

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.360
<i>Are you okay with that, babe?</i>

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.400
<i>I'm so happy right now.</i>

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.840
<i>And you? Are you happy too?</i>

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.080
<i>Maybe Maewnam has a way to help you.</i>

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.720
<i>Your store's definitely going to make it.</i>

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.800
<i>Right now, I'm not fighting alone anymore.</i>

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.720
<i>I have a partner</i>
<i>who's ready to fight alongside me.</i>

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.000
<i>Right?</i>

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.440
The way you think
is seriously the coolest, Wan.

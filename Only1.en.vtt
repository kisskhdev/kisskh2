WEBVTT

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.920
EIGHT YEARS AGO

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.440
- Where are you off to, sweetie?
- Help!

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.160
Help!

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.960
Hey!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.840
- Come on.
- What's the rush?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.640
Help me!

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.800
Let go!

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.240
- No, please. No…
- Come with me.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
Please, just let me go…

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.120
What the…

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.680
Don't you dare mess with girls again.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.840
- Go away!
- We're leaving!

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.280
Let's go!

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.560
Go!

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.880
Can you get up?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.760
Are you hurt?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.480
How are you getting home?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.080
My driver should be nearby.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.720
But my phone's dead.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280
Come on.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.920
I'll walk you to your car.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.840
Wear this.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.120
Your shirt's too thin.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.000
Oh, that's my car!

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840
Well…

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.600
Thank you so much for helping me today.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.160
I'm Ayla. What's your name?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.640
Thank you.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.000
Mr. Jacket.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.320
Why is your owner so cool?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.000
She took on three guys
like it was nothing.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.440
Whack! Whack! Whack! Just like that!

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
So gorgeous. So tough. So cool.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.360
Only flaw?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.160
She wouldn't even tell me her name.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.440
How am I supposed to return this?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.480
I'll probably never see her again.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.640
Stay with me, okay?

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680
I'm talking to the jacket?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.400
Hi, new girl! What's your name?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.720
I'm Ayla.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.360
Full name?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.160
Sasina.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
And your last name?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.320
Ruengkunakorn.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.280
Nice to meet you, new friend!
I'm Khaotu, Suthasinee Sawangkamol.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.280
I've been here since grade seven.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.480
Great to meet you, Ayla Sasina.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.200
- Nice to--
- If you need help with anything, just ask.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.440
Because

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.280
I know everyone and everything
in this school.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.000
And if you're worried about grades,
don't be.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.120
Because…

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.840
I get straight A's in every subject.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.880
That's impressive.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.000
Want to hang out in class first, or--

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.760
Oh!

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.000
Khaotu?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.400
PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.000
- Lucky we made it in time.
- What are they competing in?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.680
<i>Hajime!</i>

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.560
It's called Kendo.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.680
Pretty simple.
Whoever lands a hit scores a point.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.600
Amazing!

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.640
- She's so cool!
- Right?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720
<i>Dome!</i>

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.360
<i>Kawaré!</i>

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.160
Sit down!

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.800
That girl…

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.680
Her name's Tawan. She's in Grade 12.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.840
Top student, student council president,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.240
and the school's best kendo athlete.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.760
She's been champion three years in a row.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.960
Top of the class, star athlete…

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.880
She's basically good at everything.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.760
And she's gorgeous too.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.440
No, cool. That's what you call cool.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.240
Anyway, what club
are you thinking of joining, Ayla?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.880
KENDO CLUB SIGN-UP

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.280
Are you sure about this?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.560
Of course. I want to join the Kendo club.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.880
Just so you know…

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.880
Training's pretty intense.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.800
I'm not sure you can handle it.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.040
I definitely can.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.960
I'm ready for it. I'm totally fired up.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.280
<i>All right. Let's run a little test first.</i>

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.840
Everyone ready?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320
Ready!

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.400
That weak-looking one?
No way she's gonna make it.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.680
Look at her. She's about to pass out.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.440
If she wants to join, let her.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.520
Yeah, true.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.320
Then who's gonna train her?

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.840
I will.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.880
You said it.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.120
You're training her, then. Deal?

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.040
Deal.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.040
All right.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.720
Kid, you don't need to run anymore.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.240
You're in. Great effort.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.360
See you at practice tomorrow.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.480
Get up and drink some water.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.880
Tawan!

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.160
I feel dizzy…

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920
You okay?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.520
Thank you, Tawan.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.840
Do you remember me?

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.240
Well, you know my name now.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.160
Just know,
this club's no walk in the park.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.000
Got it.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.800
I'll give it everything I've got.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.400
Thanks for letting me join.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.880
Go on.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.920
Head home.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.960
See you at practice tomorrow,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.360
Ayla.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.920
Bye, Tawan!

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.600
She knows my name!

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.360
She knows my name!

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.960
Before we begin training,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.960
I'm going to demonstrate
a few Kendo basics.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.200
<i>Kikaeshi, hajime!</i>

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.320
<i>Men, hajime!</i>

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.640
<i>Kote, hajime!</i>

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.800
<i>Do, hajime!</i>

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.760
<i>Tokyo!</i>

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.680
Now, we're starting with the basics.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.080
Ready?

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.520
Ready!

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.960
<i>Kendo, the way of the sword,</i>

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.680
<i>is rooted in samurai swordsmanship.</i>

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.720
Training involves

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.880
fast, forceful, decisive moves,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.560
so it demands intense focus.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.320
Here.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.280
Hurry up! Run!

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.240
Hey! I want one too!

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.560
Fine, take it.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.680
I want one too!

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.680
HELLO

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.080
Tawan accepted mine.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.000
She did! She did!

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.920
She accepted my gift.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.240
It's really pouring out there.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.920
Tawan!

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.800
You're still here?

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.240
I happened to forget my umbrella.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.120
I forgot mine too.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.000
Then… want to make something
to stop the rain?

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.560
Something to stop the rain? Like what?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.000
A <i>teru teru bōzu</i>.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.960
A <i>teru teru bōzu</i>?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.840
Look.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.800
Oh!

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.440
You drew the sun. That's so cool.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.480
Tawan means "sun".

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.520
You drew a moon?

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.840
Yes.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.520
Why a moon?

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.080
Because Ayla means "moon".

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.640
The sun and the moon.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.840
Tawan and Ayla.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.800
The rain stopped!

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.280
It actually worked!

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.880
Thank you, Mr. Teru Teru Bōzu.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.080
Tawan.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.360
It's all right. Thank you.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.800
I'll take that.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.840
Tawan.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.160
Think you're special, huh, new girl?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.000
Just 'cause Tawan took your drink,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.880
you think
you're better than the rest of us?

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.040
Acting all high and mighty.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.320
You want a drink? Fine.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.200
Here. Not just a glass.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.120
Have a whole bucket!

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.080
No… No!

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.600
Tawan!

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.480
Tawan!

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.040
Was that really necessary?

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to splash you.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.920
It was meant for that new girl.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.960
She just got here and now
she's all over you? How's that fair?

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.960
So, I'm the reason this happened?

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.560
I really don't like this kind of behavior.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.840
Bullying someone is never okay.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.080
You shouldn't treat anyone like this.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.680
Ever.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.080
I'm honestly disappointed in myself

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.320
for not being a better example to you all.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.560
No, Tawan.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.200
It's not your fault.
You're amazing, always have been.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.840
We're the ones in the wrong.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.000
We're really sorry. We mean it.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.800
Then, let's end it here. I'm asking you.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.200
Sure.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.440
If you ask, I'll do it.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.440
Let's call it even.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520
Huh?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.200
Even? Just like that?

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.320
Yeah.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.080
Tawan asked, so that's that.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.080
Are you okay?

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.640
Thank you, Tawan,

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.760
for helping me.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.040
You always protect me.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.000
You're like my personal bodyguard.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.080
Bodyguard?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.000
Mhm.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.880
I'm expensive, you know.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.720
Think you can afford me?

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.960
Can I ask you something?

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.400
Sure.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.760
You like dancing, don't you?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.960
I do. I love dancing.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.840
How'd you know?

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.760
I saw you

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.360
when you were cleaning the clubroom floor.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.240
You were basically dancing the dirt away.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.280
What?

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.080
Tawan accepted my gift.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.600
You saw all of that?

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.520
Every second.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.360
Even this part.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.920
I want to cry.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.640
You really saw everything?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.920
Our school has a strong dance club,
you know.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.520
I think you should audition.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.600
Kendo might be a bit too intense for you.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.680
No, I like Kendo.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.320
I like it.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.080
I really do.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.640
You like Kendo

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.600
more than dancing?

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.960
Not sure

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.320
I believe that.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480
Why not?

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.800
Do I look that hopeless?

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.120
Not hopeless.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.480
You're not giving me much hope here.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.200
Trust me.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.760
Do what your heart really wants.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.720
It'll be worth it.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.960
But…

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.880
if I leave the Kendo club,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.280
I won't get to talk to you
like this every day.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280
Sure you will.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.720
If you see me, just come say hi.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.480
Or…

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.240
I'll still be training here.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.520
You can drop by anytime you want.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.240
Promise?

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.840
Yeah.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.160
Promise.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.480
- I've got something for you.
- Huh?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.560
What is it?

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.760
AUDITIONS: SCHOOL DANCE TEAM
REPRESENTATIVE FOR ANNUAL COMPETITION

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.400
You want me to audition
for a dance competition?

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.800
Yep.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.800
I want you to try out.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.360
Think of it
as a way to challenge yourself.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.880
Do you think I'm good enough?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.040
There are already
so many amazing dancers in the club.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.360
Come on.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.280
Just give it a shot.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.600
No harm in trying.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.400
Think of it as gaining experience.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.600
Okay then.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.840
I'll do it.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.680
But if I compete, will you come watch me?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.000
I'll try to make it.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.800
Promise?

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.120
Promise.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.640
You better not break it.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.320
Sure.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.800
DANCE AND PERFORMANCE CLUB

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.920
Super pinky promise!

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.800
Super pinky promise.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.159
Ayla.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.360
Tawan!

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.920
I thought you weren't going
to come watch me!

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.639
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.400
I had something to take care of.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:52.679
It's okay. Just the fact that you're here
already makes me so happy.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.560
Now I've got all the motivation I need!

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.320
I made a promise, didn't I?

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.960
What happened to your lip?

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.120
Just a little accident.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.120
Nothing serious.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.200
Hang on. I've got ointment with me.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.680
You carry stuff like this all the time?

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.280
Yup. I'm super clumsy,
so I always keep some on me.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.560
Here, let me put some on for you.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.280
So it doesn't scar.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.360
Done!

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.960
Take it with you and reapply later,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.640
so it heals up nice and smooth, okay?

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.840
Hello, Khaotu?

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.640
I'm heading in now.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.800
Okay.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.120
I've gotta go get ready now.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.800
Watch me, okay?

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.920
Ayla.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.120
For you.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.720
A school badge?

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.200
But you haven't even graduated yet.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.560
Think of it as a lucky charm.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.360
Thank you!

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.160
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.720
Ayla! Ayla! Ayla!

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.920
THAILAND PASSPORT

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.320
<i>There's something I want to tell you.</i>

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.800
<i>Thank you for always helping me,</i>
<i>looking out for me.</i>

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.160
<i>Those snacks in your locker…</i>

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.040
<i>That was just</i>
<i>my little way of saying thanks.</i>

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.920
<i>I'm really glad</i>
<i>I got to be at the same school as you.</i>

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.440
<i>Got to be close to you.</i>

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.720
<i>And finally,</i>

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.160
<i>I love you, Tawan.</i>

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.240
<i>I hope…</i>

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.480
<i>you feel the same.</i>

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.320
What are you doing falling asleep here?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.320
I was waiting for Tawan.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.680
Do you know where she is?

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.760
She didn't tell you?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.880
Tell me what?

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.760
She's transferred schools.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.560
Transferred?

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.880
Where did she go?

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.440
Do you have her address?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.560
Can I help you with something?

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.160
I'm looking for Tawan.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.840
Is this her house?

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.520
Ms. Tawan doesn't live here anymore.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.600
So,

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.760
do you happen to have her phone number?

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.560
I'm afraid I don't. I'm really sorry.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.920
Now that you're alone,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.320
the rain just won't stop, huh?

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.640
Let's go back together, alright?

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.320
<i>Ayla, can you promise me something?</i>

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.680
From this day on, no matter what happens,

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.240
don't ever forget who you are.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.440
Study hard.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.920
Keep chasing your dreams.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.560
I believe your determination

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.400
will lead you to something beautiful.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.720
Stay strong.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.800
I'll always be rooting for you.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.560
<i>I promised you I'd give it my all.</i>

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.680
<i>That I'd chase my dreams, no matter what.</i>

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.160
<i>One day, the spotlight will shine on me.</i>

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.040
<i>And when that day comes,</i>

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.480
<i>when the whole world is watching,</i>

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.640
<i>you'll see me again.</i>

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.680
<i>And I'm going to get you back, Tawan.</i>

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.440
Not good enough!

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.680
Go train again.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.480
<i>I no longer trust your agency.</i>

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.480
I'll find a personal bodyguard
for my daughter myself.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.520
From what I've heard,

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.440
none of our bodyguards
meet your VIP's criteria

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.120
<i>I don't think we'll be needing</i>
<i>a new agency after all, Dad.</i>

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.080
Pleasure working with you,

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.240
Ms. Bodyguard.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.040
<i>We also have some additional rules.</i>

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.840
You must stay within visual range

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.280
of your bodyguard at all times.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.760
<i>And what exactly is "visual range"?</i>

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.280
Can you see me now?

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.200

- You're mistaken. Let's go out-

Sun Chaek fainted right at that moment.

00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:35.773
That must be the answer.

00:06:35.797 --> 00:06:39.787
Are you saying he is a
fortuneteller or something?

00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:45.237
I am so confused.

00:06:45.297 --> 00:06:49.377
Sun Chaek, by chance, did you happen to

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:51.703
give away our wealth?

I suppose you are right.

00:06:57.297 --> 00:07:01.973
Now that I think about it,
he called us brothers-in-law.

00:07:01.997 --> 00:07:04.283

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:06.527
Prince Gyeongseong

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:12.643
must love his people dearly.

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.253
He thinks of the people as his family.

00:07:14.277 --> 00:07:15.693
Prince Gyeongseong is not like that.

00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:18.673

00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:20.373
Rumors could be different than reality.

00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:22.913
He must be off guard sometimes, too.

No, no. Let us go.

00:07:37.697 --> 00:07:39.013
Are you not bored?

00:07:39.037 --> 00:07:40.603
Prince Gyeongseong will barge in.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.383
To the door. Watch where you are going.

00:07:42.407 --> 00:07:43.513
Call us over if you are bored.

00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:46.097
Get back safely.

00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:09.843
If the Palace finds out about this,

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:11.723
you know that I'm done, right?

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:14.283
It'd be fine if you cured
her once and for all.

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:16.673
I gave her an acupuncture treatment,

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:22.083

that will treat her immediately.

00:08:22.107 --> 00:08:24.543
Why do you not bring it here immediately?

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:26.417
The thing is...

00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:30.827
Anyone inside?

00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:36.007
Hello!

Anyone inside?

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:46.703
Maybe try again in the morning.

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:48.457
Step aside.

00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:50.953
Will you break the door?

00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:53.013
If it does not open,

00:08:53.037 --> 00:08:55.127
I should break it down.

00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:11.533
Why raise a ruckus in
front of someone's house?

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:14.833

00:09:14.857 --> 00:09:17.837
I am the only one who is awake now.

00:09:23.587 --> 00:09:25.843
You look young.

00:09:25.867 --> 00:09:28.063
Yet you speak down to us.

00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:31.713
You judge a person
based on their appearance.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.483
You are a foolish human, too.

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:37.333
You! How dare you speak that way to him.

Medicinal herbs do not discriminate.

00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:43.627
It goes to those who desperately need it.

00:09:44.947 --> 00:09:47.377
I think

00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:52.983
you are here for chamber bitter.

00:09:53.007 --> 00:09:54.657
Do you have chamber bitter?

00:09:54.697 --> 00:09:57.367
I am sorry. Even if we
did, I would not sell it.

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:00.053
- Do you even have it?
- If we do,

00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.887
will you take it from me?

<i>Bring that back.</i>

00:10:21.377 --> 00:10:24.087
<i>I will sell you the chamber bitter, then.</i>

00:10:57.337 --> 00:10:59.777
What was the meaning of that?

00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:04.607
<i>Beon has never treated me coldly.</i>

00:11:05.757 --> 00:11:07.723

Of course,

you were not a normal kid.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.063

ended up in the pharmacy,

00:14:51.287 --> 00:14:53.873
sent by the mountain spirit.

00:14:53.897 --> 00:14:56.637
I know how to read people.

00:15:02.447 --> 00:15:03.867
Here.

00:15:09.247 --> 00:15:11.993
I keep my promises.

00:15:12.017 --> 00:15:15.287
That is very rare stuff.

00:15:16.097 --> 00:15:19.347
It is for a woman you love, right?

00:15:21.557 --> 00:15:23.433
As you said,

00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:26.557
I am not just a normal kid.

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:34.427
Are you on your way to play another trick?

00:15:37.397 --> 00:15:41.513
I'm going to the village to find a way
to play tricks without getting caught.

00:15:41.537 --> 00:15:45.527
Let us say hello happily
if we meet again, Ahjussi.

00:16:15.807 --> 00:16:19.673
It was a spectacular night.

00:16:19.697 --> 00:16:21.483
I cannot believe I fainted.

00:16:21.507 --> 00:16:23.963
But how could I have not?

00:16:23.987 --> 00:16:26.813
To live or to get married.

00:16:26.837 --> 00:16:29.787
That is the question.

00:16:30.527 --> 00:16:33.623
Can you not just get married?

00:16:33.647 --> 00:16:34.917
What?

00:16:35.917 --> 00:16:39.453
To be honest, I do not
know why you try so hard.

00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:41.493
You ran away, had a spending spree,
and even joined a temple.

00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:42.653
You tried everything,

00:16:42.677 --> 00:16:44.953
but Prince Gyeongseong does not mind.

00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:47.803
He says it still has to be you.

00:16:47.827 --> 00:16:49.573
It's

00:16:49.597 --> 00:16:51.827
because that place doesn't belong to me.

00:16:52.697 --> 00:16:54.033
It belongs to whoever takes it first.

00:16:54.057 --> 00:16:56.637
There is no one entitled to it.

00:16:58.137 --> 00:17:00.873
<i>You can't go after someone else's man.</i>

00:17:00.897 --> 00:17:02.783
<i>No matter how much you want him,</i>

00:17:02.807 --> 00:17:06.127
<i>you can't go after someone else's man.</i>

00:17:08.617 --> 00:17:11.863
Are you feeling ill, My Lady?

00:17:11.887 --> 00:17:15.297
I just remembered a bad memory.

00:17:20.007 --> 00:17:21.967
P-Prince Gyeongseong?

00:17:32.097 --> 00:17:34.127
I am glad you woke up.

00:17:38.827 --> 00:17:40.623
Here.

00:17:40.647 --> 00:17:42.493
What is this?

00:17:42.517 --> 00:17:44.117
It is a medicinal herb.

00:17:48.507 --> 00:17:50.633
But what is it for...

00:17:50.657 --> 00:17:54.397
It apparently cures any illnesses.

00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:03.153
Make sure to prepare it for her

00:18:03.177 --> 00:18:04.613
without skipping a day.

00:18:04.637 --> 00:18:06.337
Yes, My Lord.

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:13.607
By chance, did you get hurt?

00:18:17.607 --> 00:18:21.173
Are you worried about me?

00:18:21.197 --> 00:18:23.943
No, it's not that.

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:27.413
You'd worry when even
a neighbor's dog got injured.

00:18:27.437 --> 00:18:29.883
Everyone feels pain when they're hurt.

00:18:29.907 --> 00:18:32.963
It might hurt more
if you don't get treated quickly.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.153
You do not have to worry about that.

00:18:35.177 --> 00:18:37.227
I am okay.

00:18:39.087 --> 00:18:40.577
Oh

00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:46.187
The club Jung Su Gyeom started.

00:18:47.197 --> 00:18:49.357
I will let you attend their meeting.

00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:54.367
I thought you could use a little breather.

00:19:04.087 --> 00:19:05.353
Did I hear him correctly?

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.083
He said you can attend
the Seonmun Club meeting.

00:19:08.107 --> 00:19:09.583
Did he not?

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.923
Did the sun rise from the west today?

00:19:11.947 --> 00:19:16.023
What's gotten into that obsessive psycho?

00:19:16.047 --> 00:19:19.393
How did he get this rare herb?

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:23.253
I understand this is
rarer than wild ginseng.

00:19:23.277 --> 00:19:25.033
Prince Gyeongseong must have

00:19:25.057 --> 00:19:28.063
gotten this after going through an ordeal.

00:19:28.087 --> 00:19:32.083
You must take it and
get rejuvenated, My Lady.

00:19:32.107 --> 00:19:35.373
He got this medicinal herb for me?

00:19:35.397 --> 00:19:38.383
I think this is truly

00:19:38.407 --> 00:19:41.767
the love of the century.

00:19:45.757 --> 00:19:47.593
Love?

00:19:47.617 --> 00:19:51.137
I don't think I should get
involved with him more.

00:19:57.427 --> 00:19:58.857
<i>Here.</i>

00:20:02.187 --> 00:20:04.303
To begin with, this doesn't belong to me.

00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:07.287
Is it okay to take it?

00:20:13.327 --> 00:20:16.027
Beon, where have you been...

00:20:20.607 --> 00:20:22.977
What happened to your face?

00:20:35.887 --> 00:20:38.273
- My Lady.
- Oh, my gosh!

00:20:38.297 --> 00:20:41.173
What are you thinking about so intently?

00:20:41.197 --> 00:20:43.103
It's nothing. What is it?

00:20:43.127 --> 00:20:46.183
It is a letter from Lady Eun Ae.

00:20:46.207 --> 00:20:48.087
Lady Eun Ae?

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:54.693
<i>Lady Sun Chaek,</i>

00:20:54.717 --> 00:20:57.893
<i>my sudden letter might have surprised you.</i>

00:20:57.917 --> 00:20:59.933
<i>But since I wanted to get to know you,</i>

00:20:59.957 --> 00:21:02.323
<i>I worked up my courage.</i>

00:21:02.347 --> 00:21:05.383
<i>If you are free tomorrow,</i>

00:21:05.407 --> 00:21:07.363
<i>I would love for you to come by</i>

00:21:07.387 --> 00:21:09.593
<i>and try our shop's new dessert.</i>

00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:12.567
She wants me to come
to her merchandise store?

00:21:13.677 --> 00:21:15.203
No, no, no.

00:21:15.227 --> 00:21:17.013
I'll do nothing from now on.

00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:20.213
<i>I will not worry about
the male or female lead.</i>

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:22.133
<i>Of course, you can say no.</i>

00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:25.293
<i>That will not bother me at all.</i>

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:26.953
<i>I was born an orphan</i>

00:21:26.977 --> 00:21:29.633
<i>and I am nothing but
a merchant's adoptive daughter.</i>

00:21:29.657 --> 00:21:34.573
<i>I have been doing fine on my own.</i>

00:21:34.597 --> 00:21:38.547
You haven't been doing fine alone.

00:21:48.577 --> 00:21:51.573
What is her deal?

00:21:51.597 --> 00:21:53.083
- Bang Wool.
- Yes?

00:21:53.107 --> 00:21:56.767
I think I came up with a brilliant idea.

00:22:11.427 --> 00:22:14.793
Will you really not tell me what happened?

00:22:14.817 --> 00:22:17.143
Will anyone believe me if I did?

00:22:17.167 --> 00:22:18.313
Just tell me first.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.117
I will decide to believe it or not then.

00:22:20.197 --> 00:22:22.513
If you will not believe me anyway,
I have no reason to tell you.

00:22:22.537 --> 00:22:24.373
I wish I knew what this was about.

00:22:24.397 --> 00:22:26.273
You really are so frustrating sometimes.

00:22:26.297 --> 00:22:27.064
Frustrating?

00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:28.913
You suddenly banned
club meetings in Hanyang.

00:22:28.937 --> 00:22:30.263
The youth have nowhere

00:22:30.287 --> 00:22:33.177
to go or nothing to do
in this desolate world.

00:22:36.597 --> 00:22:38.913
I will make an exception,

00:22:38.937 --> 00:22:40.983
and allow that club meeting.

00:22:41.007 --> 00:22:42.883
Was it the Jeongmun Club?

00:22:42.907 --> 00:22:44.423
Do you mean it?

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:47.803
You certainly are my friend, Beon.

00:22:47.827 --> 00:22:50.863
You still need to know the name
before you allow it.

00:22:50.887 --> 00:22:52.343
It is the Seonmun Club.

00:22:52.367 --> 00:22:54.163
The young men and women of Hanyang

00:22:54.187 --> 00:22:55.973
gather to study the moon and stars

00:22:55.997 --> 00:22:58.127
and talk about poetry and paintings.

00:23:00.957 --> 00:23:02.977
But I have a request.

00:23:03.667 --> 00:23:06.143
I need to join that club, too.

00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:08.067
You, Beon?

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:20.025
With the prolonged drought,

00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:22.605
the people are impoverished.

00:23:22.629 --> 00:23:24.195
I think we should open the grain storage

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:27.215
and share with the ones in need.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.945
Yes, Madam. I will participate.

00:23:29.969 --> 00:23:32.085
We will also participate.

00:23:32.109 --> 00:23:34.075
My family will give away 100 seok of

00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:36.215
white rice to set an example.

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:38.925
The rest of you can give what you can.

00:23:38.949 --> 00:23:42.315
We will give away 150 seok this time.

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.169
150 seok?

00:23:44.889 --> 00:23:46.945
You do not have to overdo it.

00:23:46.969 --> 00:23:48.445
The thing is,

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:51.585
our youngest son is getting married.

00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:53.525
- Another wedding?
- Oh, my!

00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:56.415
I want to share more to celebrate.

00:23:56.439 --> 00:23:58.105
Your youngest was
studying for the state exam.

00:23:58.129 --> 00:24:01.299
He is already getting married?

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:04.825
Your eldest got married
just a few months ago.

00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:07.475
It just happened so.

00:24:07.499 --> 00:24:11.209
I guess he wanted to get married
more than to pass the exam.

00:24:12.379 --> 00:24:14.505
He wins first place in
rushing into marriage.

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:15.829
Yes.

00:24:23.769 --> 00:24:25.455
Madam Jeong.

00:24:25.479 --> 00:24:29.135
- Yes.
- Congratulations on the wedding.

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:30.545
If you need help for the wedding,

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.435
I will send you our servants.

00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:34.975
Feel free to ask me anytime.

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:38.999
I appreciate the gesture alone.

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:49.579
Mother, did you have a nice gathering?

00:24:50.469 --> 00:24:51.545
Yes.

00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:53.675
We were debating the connection between

00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:55.745
cotton seeds and the
Moon family in the room

00:24:55.769 --> 00:24:57.915
I will dismiss you now.

00:24:57.939 --> 00:25:00.349
Take care, then.

00:25:14.249 --> 00:25:16.395
You must want a daughter-in-law.

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:19.155
Of course I do.

00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:20.565
They are old enough to marry.

00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:23.599
But none of them seem interested.

00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:25.745
Seeing them up close,

00:25:25.769 --> 00:25:27.965
they are all handsome and perfectly fine.

00:25:27.989 --> 00:25:29.585
Why should you worry?

00:25:29.609 --> 00:25:32.755
You became better at flattery.

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:34.235
They are not fine.

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:37.545
They cannot get married
because they are not.

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:41.039
I worry the family bloodline
will end at this rate.

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:45.785
Well,

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:48.825
I know someone who specializes in this.

00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:51.459
Would you like to visit them?

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:54.695
Is Beon drunk?

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.959
Or did he really mean it?

00:26:02.639 --> 00:26:04.429
Who are you?

00:26:05.889 --> 00:26:08.199
Sir Su Gyeom, it is me.

00:26:08.229 --> 00:26:12.129
Maiden, did you wait for me, by chance?

00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:14.555
You must not be feeling well, though.

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:16.575
I am okay now.

00:26:16.599 --> 00:26:18.115
Well,

00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:22.175
is your invitation to
Seonmun Club still valid?

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:24.495
Seonmun Club is suddenly so popular.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:27.059
Of course. You are welcome anytime.

00:26:27.859 --> 00:26:31.645
I have a small request, by the way.

00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:35.335
There's a friend I want to invite.

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:37.235
Can we join together?

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:39.319
It's Lady Cho Eun Ae.

00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:43.485
The name sounds familiar.

00:26:43.509 --> 00:26:44.745
That is your request?

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:46.625
Feel free to bring her.

00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:49.665
Making requests must be a trend in Hanyang.

00:26:49.689 --> 00:26:50.779
Pardon?

00:26:51.449 --> 00:26:54.225
It is nothing. Seonmun
Club was just approved.

00:26:54.249 --> 00:26:57.355
I am planning to have a meeting tonight.

00:26:57.379 --> 00:27:02.125
Did Prince Gyeongseong give that approval?

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:03.379
Yes.

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:06.589
- Since we are on the topic-
- Since we are on the topic.

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:11.219
- How about we invite Prince Gyeongseong?
- Can I invite Prince Gyeongseong?

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:14.575
Prince Gyeongseong is coming?

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:17.465
Is it okay if he comes?

00:27:17.489 --> 00:27:19.605
<i>I knew it.</i>

00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:22.205
<i>That's why he allowed it so willingly.</i>

00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:26.095
<i>We're on the same page for once.</i>

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:28.715
If you feel uncomfortable around him.

00:27:28.739 --> 00:27:30.025
No, no.

00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:31.625
Not uncomfortable at all.

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.295
He's coming, then. Right?

00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:34.525
I suppose he is.

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:38.315
Any young people should be allowed.

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.209
We can't discriminate against those
with a bad temper.

00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:46.759
Your kindhearted gesture is
so beautiful, Maiden Sun Chaek.

00:27:57.899 --> 00:27:59.925
I understand.

00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:03.055
I am tired today.

00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:05.299
You can leave now.

00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:11.345
Your Majesty,

00:28:11.369 --> 00:28:13.795
In Pyeongan-do, snow and hail fell

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:16.835
and frost fell until two months ago.

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:19.375
The seeds they sowed died

00:28:19.399 --> 00:28:22.565
and the fields dried out
due to the recent drought.

00:28:22.589 --> 00:28:27.259
They cannot even harvest wheat
and barley right now.

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:29.689
I am aware.

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:33.585
The people have been living off crops

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:36.499
and they are in danger now.

00:28:40.829 --> 00:28:43.255
Ever since I took the throne,

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:45.625
natural disasters and crises have
been emerging every month

00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:48.815
and we have had droughts
and floods every year.

00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:52.085
This is because of my lack of virtue.

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:53.935
Well

00:28:53.959 --> 00:28:57.155
do you agree with me, Chief State Minister?

00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:59.915
It is not that, Your Majesty.

00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:02.385
Please establish the
Ministry of Aid quickly

00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:03.935
and help the people.

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:05.575
Right State Minister,

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:08.655
you have been looking upset.

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:11.799
What are you so unhappy about?

00:29:12.889 --> 00:29:15.795
How could I be, Your Majesty?

00:29:15.819 --> 00:29:17.975
You speak up, too.

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:21.669
Do you think my lack of virtue is to blame?

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:30.839
How can your humble
subject judge Your Majesty?

00:29:32.879 --> 00:29:35.635
Is not showing emotion

00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:38.055
your family's characteristic?

00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:39.915
As expected of the Queen Mother's relative,

00:29:39.939 --> 00:29:42.655
you are very skilled at avoiding

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:44.545
trouble discreetly.

00:29:44.569 --> 00:29:47.369
- Your Majesty...
- I heard enough.

00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:50.609
You can leave now.

00:29:59.499 --> 00:30:01.885
I am worried something might

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:04.779
happen to you by upsetting His Majesty.

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:07.415
You said he has been sensitive

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:10.015
due to his worsening of insomnia.

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:13.495
I still need to say what I need to say.

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:17.975
We cannot delay
establishing the Relief Agency.

00:30:17.999 --> 00:30:20.475
Prince Gyeongseong is the only one
His Majesty keeps close.

00:30:20.499 --> 00:30:23.969
I am worried about the nation's security.

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:27.115
How could a single royal family member

00:30:27.139 --> 00:30:29.855
falter His Majesty's judgment?

00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:32.065
Lower your voice.

00:30:32.089 --> 00:30:35.115
If Prince Gyeongseong hears you,

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:36.625
you do not know what he might do to you.

00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:38.635
Yes, for the past 12 years,

00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:42.029
countless people were dragged out
by Prince Gyeongseong.

00:30:43.109 --> 00:30:44.575
Perhaps from now on,

00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:48.415
the hunting dog might go hunting himself.

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:51.205
If the dog goes crazy, it bites its owner.

00:30:51.229 --> 00:30:52.505
Come on.

00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:54.769
What are you saying?

00:30:55.449 --> 00:30:57.755
All right, we need to stay alive

00:30:57.779 --> 00:31:01.235
in order to convince His Majesty again
in the future.

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.049
Let us leave.

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.815
My Lady,

00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:19.985
you clearly said you will not do
anything yesterday.

00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:21.255
You saw it, too.

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.705
After reading Eun Ae's letter
yesterday, ignoring it

00:31:23.729 --> 00:31:25.769
would be not right.

00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:28.455
Bang Wool,

00:31:28.479 --> 00:31:31.145
you are colder than you seem, aren't you?

00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:34.035
Yes, my hands and feet are cold by nature.

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:36.669
I am cold deep inside my bones, too.

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:40.489
My Lady.

00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:46.329
You really came.

00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:48.895
I feel like I am dreaming.

00:31:48.919 --> 00:31:51.445
I have a friend now.

00:31:51.469 --> 00:31:53.135
Please come inside now.

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:54.925
Hold on, Lady Eun Ae.

00:31:54.949 --> 00:31:56.595
I want to do something with you

00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:58.615
to celebrate our becoming friends.

00:31:58.639 --> 00:32:01.089
Do something together?

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:04.265
With me, do you mean?

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.599
Yes.

00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:14.699
<i>I do not know. I have no idea.</i>

00:32:15.489 --> 00:32:18.159
I thought he was out.

00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:22.659
What do I do?

00:32:27.139 --> 00:32:28.825
My Lord,

00:32:28.849 --> 00:32:30.975
what is going on?

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:33.079
I have no idea.

00:32:33.989 --> 00:32:37.049
What are you talking about?

00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:40.459
Goodness.

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:48.729
I am not sure what to do.

00:32:50.489 --> 00:32:53.195
My Lord, if you do not mind,

00:32:53.219 --> 00:32:56.349
can I step in today?

00:33:08.659 --> 00:33:10.509
Lady Eun Ae.

00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:13.265
I am late, am I not?

00:33:13.289 --> 00:33:15.089
I am sorry, My Lady.

00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:17.765
You look so pretty today.

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:20.875
You asked me to look presentable.

00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:22.369
You also

00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:25.329
- look pretty.
- Gosh...

00:33:26.189 --> 00:33:29.135
<i>Eun Ae needs to shine today.</i>

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:31.245
So, this is Seolhwajae.

00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:33.255
The annex His Majesty built

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:35.965
before the Princess got married.

00:33:35.989 --> 00:33:38.275
The Princess also met her current husband

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:40.055
and married him here, too.

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:43.409
The Seonmun Club meeting
is happening here tonight.

00:33:44.639 --> 00:33:47.745
I hear there is a pond
for boats over there.

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:50.125
I cannot believe I got to come here.

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:52.815
It is all thanks to you.

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:54.345
Thank you so much.

00:33:54.369 --> 00:33:55.705
Don't thank me.

00:33:55.729 --> 00:33:58.419
I'm thankful that you joined me.

00:33:59.629 --> 00:34:01.905
<i>Why did I realize this now?</i>

00:34:01.929 --> 00:34:03.095
<i>Instead of running away,</i>

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:06.985
<i>I just need to let Eun
Ae and Yi Beon connect.</i>

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:09.095
<i>I'll ignite new sparks.</i>

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:11.045
<i>I'll do that myself.</i>

00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:12.395
Are you okay, My Lady?

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:15.269
Yes, of course. I'm fine.

00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:21.645
<i>He should be here by now.</i>

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:22.905
Over here, My Lord.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.689
Maiden Sun Chaek.

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:29.775
This is Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's daughter,

00:34:29.799 --> 00:34:32.265
Lady Cho Eun Ae.

00:34:32.289 --> 00:34:34.795
And this is Sir Jung Su Gyeom,

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:37.189
an official of Hongmungwan.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:42.035
I have often heard about
you, Maiden Eun Ae.

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:44.545
I hear you do a lot of good things.

00:34:44.569 --> 00:34:45.705
Nice to meet you.

00:34:45.729 --> 00:34:49.015
People know me because of my father.

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:52.935
Thank you for allowing
me to join Seonmun Club.

00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:54.359
Allow?

00:34:55.229 --> 00:34:59.129
Any romantic young men and women of Hanyang

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:01.275
are always welcome.

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:04.315
Please come inside.

00:35:04.339 --> 00:35:05.799
Let's go.

00:35:07.479 --> 00:35:09.719
You look beautiful.

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:12.999
Have you been well?

00:35:17.469 --> 00:35:19.115
All right.

00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:21.845
The night of Seonmun Club

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.125
you have been waiting

00:35:24.149 --> 00:35:26.499
is finally here!

00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:42.285
Let me introduce the new members.

00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:44.995
The daughter of the Chief State Minister,

00:35:45.019 --> 00:35:47.459
Maiden Cha Sun Chaek.

00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.835
And Merchant Cho Byeong
Mu's adopted daughter,

00:35:51.859 --> 00:35:54.039
Maiden Cho Eun Ae.

00:35:54.779 --> 00:35:57.385
A big round of applause, please.

00:35:57.409 --> 00:35:59.735
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

00:35:59.759 --> 00:36:02.859
Thank you for welcoming us.

00:36:03.509 --> 00:36:06.005
I am in your care going forward.

00:36:06.029 --> 00:36:08.069
Applause!

00:36:10.209 --> 00:36:12.999
<i>Is Prince Gyeongseong not here yet?</i>

00:37:01.289 --> 00:37:03.205
My heart.

00:37:03.229 --> 00:37:06.229
Are you okay, Maiden Sun Chaek?

00:37:07.519 --> 00:37:08.739
Yes.

00:37:09.429 --> 00:37:11.675
You two

00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:14.009
seem very close.

00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:18.635
Beon, I was waiting for you.

00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:21.175
It is the last newcomer
of the Seonmun Club,

00:37:21.199 --> 00:37:23.335
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:27.579
I am sure he needs no introduction...

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:35.029
He is also a young man of Joseon.

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:38.069
How long will you keep holding hands?

00:37:39.379 --> 00:37:42.435
I was worried Maiden Sun
Chaek would faint again.

00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:44.619
That is why I was holding her.

00:37:45.629 --> 00:37:50.765
<i>Is this an obvious plot where
he misunderstands and gets jealous?</i>

00:37:50.789 --> 00:37:52.659
<i>It can't be.</i>

00:37:57.409 --> 00:37:58.835
Hello.

00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:02.779
I am the third son of the
Choi family of Hwasun.

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:14.049
Nothing is more useless
than an introduction.

00:38:14.129 --> 00:38:17.329
But I still need to know his name.

00:38:17.359 --> 00:38:19.495
What is the point of learning his name?

00:38:19.519 --> 00:38:21.465
By chance,

00:38:21.489 --> 00:38:23.925
will you call each other's names sweetly

00:38:23.949 --> 00:38:26.545
and become close?

00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:28.439
Not at all.

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:33.045
Why are you doing this here?

00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:35.405
All right, all right.

00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:38.225
Let us introduce each other later.

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:41.585
Since all three new members are here,

00:38:41.609 --> 00:38:44.839
let us start the meeting now.

00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:48.519
Shall we?

00:38:50.489 --> 00:38:51.665
Shall we?

00:38:51.689 --> 00:38:53.299
Yes!

00:39:01.269 --> 00:39:03.525
Here are the sweets

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:06.675
the new member, Maiden Cho Eun Ae, brought.

00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:08.045
Let us taste them.

00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:11.605
She prepared so much for the Seonmun Club.

00:39:11.629 --> 00:39:15.805
Isn't Lady Eun Ae as beautiful
inside as she is outside?

00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:19.549
I heard Merchant Cho Byeong Mu's
sweets are very famous.

00:39:20.269 --> 00:39:22.489
This is my first time trying them.

00:39:23.269 --> 00:39:25.165
You are too kind.

00:39:25.189 --> 00:39:27.725
It is not much, but please enjoy.

00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:29.595
When the moon reaches
the top of the gazebo,

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:32.105
I will start pouring drinks.

00:39:32.129 --> 00:39:33.605
It is nice to drink,

00:39:33.629 --> 00:39:37.195
but the warm tea and
sweets will help you digest.

00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:38.779
Did you know this?

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:43.315
I heard Lady Eun Ae brews
the best of the best tea.

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:46.945
Even the envoys from China line up.

00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:51.865
This is why she is thought of
as the finest young lady of our time.

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.315
<i>Step 1.</i>

00:39:53.339 --> 00:39:55.605
<i>First impression is
everything in high society.</i>

00:39:55.629 --> 00:39:57.005
<i>Compliments don't just move whales.</i>

00:39:57.029 --> 00:39:58.755
<i>They move the high society.</i>

00:39:58.779 --> 00:40:00.135
<i>Compliment attack.</i>

00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:01.955
You are too kind.

00:40:01.979 --> 00:40:04.675
This tea's scent spreads over 100 ri,

00:40:04.699 --> 00:40:07.385
- so it is called Baekrimun-
- It also makes one confess.

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:10.055
How did you know?

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.479
I have never met anyone who knows that.

00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:14.575
My gosh.

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:17.465
You already have so much in common.

00:40:17.489 --> 00:40:22.305
I can't believe you two
have never met before.

00:40:22.329 --> 00:40:27.145
Is this what they mean by
"Finishing each other's sentences"?

00:40:27.169 --> 00:40:29.935
I have heard a lot about
you, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:33.405
You've heard of her, too.
Haven't you, Prince Gyeongseong?

00:40:33.429 --> 00:40:35.339
This is my first time.

00:40:37.399 --> 00:40:38.485
Of course.

00:40:38.509 --> 00:40:41.375
Why would you have heard of my name?

00:40:41.399 --> 00:40:42.955
<i>Moving on to Step 2.</i>

00:40:42.979 --> 00:40:45.835
<i>Sweetness heightens
one's interest in another.</i>

00:40:45.859 --> 00:40:47.245
<i>Sweetness attack.</i>

00:40:47.269 --> 00:40:48.989
Everyone,

00:40:49.029 --> 00:40:55.705
Lady Eun Ae made these juak♪ from scratch.
(Sweet rice cake)

00:40:55.729 --> 00:40:59.035
They smell so sweet.

00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:00.735
Let's all try a bite.

00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:02.449
Thank you.

00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:05.179
So tasty.

00:41:13.749 --> 00:41:15.435
Why aren't you eating, Prince Gyeongseong?

00:41:15.459 --> 00:41:17.285
I am not craving them.

00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:20.479
They're really delicious, I'm telling you.

00:41:23.729 --> 00:41:28.229
If you don't eat one,
you'll definitely regret it.

00:41:32.859 --> 00:41:36.039
You do not have to force him...

00:41:44.189 --> 00:41:45.425
It's tasty, right?

00:41:45.449 --> 00:41:47.015
Isn't it the best?

00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:49.535
Its taste dulls one's mind.

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:51.245
Dulls one's mind?

00:41:51.269 --> 00:41:52.825
He means

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:54.765
that's how tasty it is.

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:56.909
No, what I meant is.

00:42:08.129 --> 00:42:11.369
Wow. Even a man like me finds them tasty.

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:13.985
I am sure they will sell well.

00:42:14.009 --> 00:42:17.525
Gosh, that's exactly what I thought.

00:42:17.549 --> 00:42:20.035
I thought so, too.

00:42:20.059 --> 00:42:23.745
I will give you plenty
more to take home, then.

00:42:23.769 --> 00:42:25.585
Yes, thank you.

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.369
I do not need any.

00:42:29.389 --> 00:42:31.255
<i>Sweetness doesn't work with him.</i>

00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:34.325
<i>He's as bitter as poison.</i>

00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:36.749
<i>Let's move on to the next step.</i>

00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:40.255
Didn't you say there's a special event

00:42:40.279 --> 00:42:43.485
for the new members tonight?

00:42:43.509 --> 00:42:46.155
Yes, that is correct.

00:42:46.179 --> 00:42:49.525
To celebrate three new members
joining the Seonmu Club,

00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:52.695
I hid notes with poems written on them

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:55.005
all over Seolhwajae.

00:42:55.029 --> 00:42:59.429
The one who finds one first
and finishes the poem

00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:03.245
will be awarded.

00:43:03.269 --> 00:43:05.335
One of these notes

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:07.755
have a gold ring inside it.

00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:11.575
The one who finds it will keep it.

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:12.975
It is a real gold ring, right?

00:43:12.999 --> 00:43:16.305
He said there is one. I will find it first.

00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:17.695
Let us go, too. Let us.

00:43:17.719 --> 00:43:20.685
You have until nine o'clock.

00:43:20.709 --> 00:43:23.325
Find the hidden treasures,
and we will regroup.

00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:27.745
Gosh, I should go find the treasure.

00:43:27.769 --> 00:43:29.525
Come with me, My Lady.

00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:31.099
Okay.

00:43:38.219 --> 00:43:39.729
Beon,

00:43:40.729 --> 00:43:41.686
are you not going?

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.115
I do not need treasure.

00:43:44.139 --> 00:43:45.969
Because recently,

00:43:46.969 --> 00:43:48.865
I acquired the biggest treasure.

00:43:48.889 --> 00:43:51.495
If you do not follow the rules,

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:54.955
I will F.R. you from the club as a leader.

00:43:54.979 --> 00:43:56.255
F.R.?

00:43:56.279 --> 00:43:59.475
Forcibly remove.

00:43:59.499 --> 00:44:03.879
- You will do that to me?
- Why do you not go ahead and try me?

00:44:14.128 --> 00:44:17.664
Where are the notes hidden, anyway?

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.838
It is too dark.

00:44:20.768 --> 00:44:23.824
I think I heard it's in the garden toward

00:44:23.848 --> 00:44:26.094
the end of the pond over there.

00:44:26.118 --> 00:44:28.258
Let us go there together, then.

00:44:30.628 --> 00:44:32.454
My stomach...

00:44:32.478 --> 00:44:34.934
My lower stomach is churning.

00:44:34.958 --> 00:44:36.904
Are you okay, My Lady?

00:44:36.928 --> 00:44:39.814
I think I need to go to the outhouse.

00:44:39.838 --> 00:44:41.794
I'll join you after I'm done.

00:44:41.818 --> 00:44:44.094
Hurry before other people find it.

00:44:44.118 --> 00:44:46.404
Hurry, hurry. Get going.

00:44:46.428 --> 00:44:47.818
Go.

00:44:49.508 --> 00:44:51.138
Go.

00:45:01.528 --> 00:45:03.694
Where could it be?

00:45:03.718 --> 00:45:05.384
Have you been to the garden over there?

00:45:05.408 --> 00:45:07.304
- Not yet.
- Shall we go?

00:45:07.328 --> 00:45:09.074
I already went there.

00:45:09.098 --> 00:45:11.714
I didn't see anything there.

00:45:11.738 --> 00:45:12.784
Is that so?

00:45:12.808 --> 00:45:14.404
I only got dirt on my hands.

00:45:14.428 --> 00:45:17.624
It was such a waste of time.

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.734
As I heard,

00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:24.748
the book storage over
there has a ton of notes.

00:45:24.798 --> 00:45:27.594
I'm sharing this only with you.

00:45:27.618 --> 00:45:28.874
Thank you, My Lady.

00:45:28.898 --> 00:45:30.648
Let us go.

00:45:36.198 --> 00:45:38.474
I barely managed to distract them.

00:45:38.498 --> 00:45:41.944
You cannot cheat like that.

00:45:41.968 --> 00:45:44.968
Gosh, Sir Su Gyeom.

00:45:45.788 --> 00:45:48.024
You were there.

00:45:48.048 --> 00:45:51.208
- It's not that. I-
- I was kidding.

00:45:52.088 --> 00:45:54.144
It was a little awkward when.

00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:56.654
Prince Gyeongseong showed up earlier.

00:45:56.678 --> 00:45:59.454
But thanks to you, things became lively.

00:45:59.478 --> 00:46:01.424
I feel so relieved.

00:46:01.448 --> 00:46:04.324
You accepted my suggestion
to do a treasure hunt.

00:46:04.348 --> 00:46:09.278
Just as the novel said,
you're sweet and sensitive.

00:46:10.148 --> 00:46:12.144
Aigoo. N-Never mind.

00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:14.434
The moment I met you,

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:17.444
I noticed how unique and fun you are.

00:46:17.468 --> 00:46:20.584
Thanks to you, the members are
having fun like children.

00:46:20.608 --> 00:46:22.938
It makes me feel happy.

00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:28.534
On a night where young men
and women have gathered,

00:46:28.558 --> 00:46:31.594
anything could happen, right?

00:46:31.618 --> 00:46:33.308
Of course.

00:46:34.988 --> 00:46:38.878
Looks like you are
awaiting something more fun.

00:46:41.588 --> 00:46:43.974
I will rest in the garden

00:46:43.998 --> 00:46:46.004
until they find the treasures.

00:46:46.028 --> 00:46:48.184
You can't.

00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:49.204
Pardon?

00:46:49.228 --> 00:46:52.428
You need to stay with me.

00:47:11.838 --> 00:47:14.238
Is it not here, either?

00:47:25.108 --> 00:47:27.288
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:47:45.628 --> 00:47:48.784
Where are these petals coming from?

00:47:48.808 --> 00:47:51.834
<i>When Eun Ae enters the garden
and runs into Prince Gyeongseong,</i>

00:47:51.858 --> 00:47:54.234
<i>scatter petals on them.</i>

00:47:54.258 --> 00:47:57.718
<i>Why should I be doing this here?</i>

00:47:59.488 --> 00:48:03.184
<i>Recreating the serendipitous first
encounter from the novel.</i>

00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:07.714
<i>You two fell in love right at this moment.</i>

00:48:07.738 --> 00:48:10.254
<i>All right. It's time to focus.</i>

00:48:10.278 --> 00:48:12.448
<i>Ready, go.</i>

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:16.758
How beautiful is this?

00:48:29.758 --> 00:48:32.884
Petals make my nose itchy.

00:48:32.908 --> 00:48:34.004
I hate it.

00:48:34.028 --> 00:48:36.004
Oh, I see.

00:48:36.028 --> 00:48:38.784
Excuse me, Maiden Do Hwa Seon.

00:48:38.808 --> 00:48:40.228
Pardon?

00:48:41.528 --> 00:48:45.224
My name is not Do Hwa Seon.

00:48:45.248 --> 00:48:47.024
My name is Cho Eun Ae.

00:48:47.048 --> 00:48:48.608
Was it?

00:48:49.448 --> 00:48:50.415
I was mistaken.

00:48:50.439 --> 00:48:53.738
Why that name out of all names?

00:48:55.378 --> 00:48:58.854
<i>If my plan happens to go awry,</i>

00:48:58.878 --> 00:49:00.768
<i>release that thing.</i>

00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:10.604
It's too shaky, Sir.

00:49:10.628 --> 00:49:12.594
Could you stand straight?

00:49:12.618 --> 00:49:14.494
I am fine, Maiden Sun Chaek.

00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:16.588
Please relax as you look.

00:49:25.718 --> 00:49:28.744
<i>Things did go the way I wanted.</i>

00:49:28.768 --> 00:49:31.788
<i>Why do I feel so melancholy?</i>

00:50:21.228 --> 00:50:22.984
I was avoiding a rat.

00:50:23.008 --> 00:50:24.944
My apologies.

00:50:24.968 --> 00:50:27.794
Of course, you should apologize.

00:50:27.818 --> 00:50:29.694
You do not know how precious this sword is.

00:50:29.718 --> 00:50:31.948
It is because I was caught off guard.

00:50:32.668 --> 00:50:34.144
How much does it cost?

00:50:34.168 --> 00:50:37.238
I will compensate you if it is damaged.

00:50:40.578 --> 00:50:42.258
Compensate?

00:50:43.438 --> 00:50:46.444
No money in this world can buy this sword.

00:50:46.468 --> 00:50:48.064
I-I did not know.

00:50:48.088 --> 00:50:50.108
My apologies.

00:50:52.618 --> 00:50:53.964
You had better not.

00:50:53.988 --> 00:50:55.904
If you knew,

00:50:55.928 --> 00:50:58.268
you would not be alive now.

00:51:06.038 --> 00:51:07.678
Sword?

00:51:54.098 --> 00:51:56.858
I knew a noblewoman would come today.

00:52:05.698 --> 00:52:08.328
What are you here to ask about?

00:52:09.528 --> 00:52:11.514
Well

00:52:11.538 --> 00:52:14.404
these are my sons' fortune readings.

00:52:14.428 --> 00:52:17.458
Would any of them get married this year?

00:52:40.438 --> 00:52:42.768
It will not be easy!

00:52:46.268 --> 00:52:50.318
Can even one of them get married?

00:52:54.218 --> 00:52:56.414
You are not showing enough effort.

00:52:56.438 --> 00:52:57.964
This is about finding
the love of one's life.

00:52:57.988 --> 00:53:01.388
You cannot expect it for free.

00:53:18.978 --> 00:53:22.658
She is young, but all she wants is money.

00:53:32.968 --> 00:53:36.888
Gosh, he is finally here.

00:53:40.978 --> 00:53:42.888
Everything is okay now.

00:53:44.748 --> 00:53:45.814
Okay.

00:53:45.838 --> 00:53:47.534
Do not worry.

00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:50.194
Your family will have a celebration soon.

00:53:50.218 --> 00:53:52.854
- Celebration?
- There will be a wedding.

00:53:52.878 --> 00:53:55.324
Is that true?

00:53:55.348 --> 00:53:57.874
Would that be possible?

00:53:57.898 --> 00:53:59.704
I am telling you.

00:53:59.728 --> 00:54:01.664
Finally.

00:54:01.688 --> 00:54:03.544
Finally, my Jang Ho...

00:54:03.568 --> 00:54:05.574
My eldest son Jang Ho is finally

00:54:05.598 --> 00:54:08.038
I do not know who it will be yet.

00:54:10.118 --> 00:54:13.124
But it is definitely just one of them.

00:54:13.148 --> 00:54:15.034
Do not ask for more.

00:54:15.058 --> 00:54:17.098
You will get hurt, then.

00:54:23.918 --> 00:54:26.864
The flowers that look like azaleas

00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:30.138
blossomed and turned red overnight.

00:54:37.498 --> 00:54:39.574
Raise the glasses,

00:54:39.598 --> 00:54:41.314
and face the bright moon.

00:54:41.338 --> 00:54:43.184
<i>Things seemed to be going well.</i>

00:54:43.208 --> 00:54:46.734
<i>What happened in that nick of time?</i>

00:54:46.758 --> 00:54:49.024
<i>Eun Ae dressed prettily today.</i>

00:54:49.048 --> 00:54:50.724
<i>She's like a wet mouse now.</i>

00:54:50.748 --> 00:54:52.904
Hug the wine jar,

00:54:52.928 --> 00:54:56.378
and face the fresh wind.

00:55:08.878 --> 00:55:10.614
None of us here

00:55:10.638 --> 00:55:14.464
can get drunk on alcohol or poetry.

00:55:14.488 --> 00:55:16.134
I think we should call it a night.

00:55:16.158 --> 00:55:17.788
We can't!

00:55:18.788 --> 00:55:21.148
No one can leave.

00:55:25.948 --> 00:55:28.814
I did not come to this meeting

00:55:28.838 --> 00:55:32.024
to let it end so unceremoniously.

00:55:32.048 --> 00:55:34.684
I was going to save this one, but...

00:55:34.708 --> 00:55:38.834
To be honest, I'm not a good poet.

00:55:38.858 --> 00:55:41.684
But for our first meeting,

00:55:41.708 --> 00:55:45.804
I'm thinking of showing off
another talent of mine.

00:55:45.828 --> 00:55:48.904
Some of you might've heard about it.

00:55:48.928 --> 00:55:52.478
I'm thinking of making cocktails.

00:56:18.168 --> 00:56:22.218
She must have been a
fish in her previous life.

00:56:29.668 --> 00:56:33.164
Take the penalty drink.

00:56:33.188 --> 00:56:36.404
Maiden Sun Chaek!

00:56:36.428 --> 00:56:38.898
Forgive me just once.

00:56:40.578 --> 00:56:43.054
If you were going to say no like this,

00:56:43.078 --> 00:56:46.874
why did you ask me how to make cocktails?

00:56:46.898 --> 00:56:51.194
I am so disappointed.

00:56:51.218 --> 00:56:53.438
My goodness.

00:56:54.388 --> 00:56:56.328
Okay, then.

00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:02.738
Goodness.

00:57:03.728 --> 00:57:06.264
Do you mind

00:57:06.288 --> 00:57:09.098
if I drink the penalty drink for you?

00:57:10.188 --> 00:57:11.504
Lady Eun Ae?

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:15.234
I cannot let a woman
drink something so strong...

00:57:15.258 --> 00:57:16.664
Geez. Come on.

00:57:16.688 --> 00:57:18.804
Can I not?

00:57:18.828 --> 00:57:22.384
In the world of drinking games,

00:57:22.408 --> 00:57:23.754
a substitute

00:57:23.778 --> 00:57:28.144
I mean, having a stand-in is allowed.

00:57:28.168 --> 00:57:30.464
But Sir Su Gyeom later

00:57:30.488 --> 00:57:34.798
has to grant Lady Eun Ae's wish.

00:57:53.678 --> 00:57:55.864
I will tell you my wish later.

00:57:55.888 --> 00:57:57.624
Okay.

00:57:57.648 --> 00:57:59.264
Thank you, Maiden Eun Ae.

00:57:59.288 --> 00:58:02.894
Lady Eun Ae, were you
always a good drinker?

00:58:02.918 --> 00:58:04.714
I am feeling thirsty and

00:58:04.738 --> 00:58:07.174
craving alcohol tonight.

00:58:07.198 --> 00:58:09.194
Did something bad happen?

00:58:09.218 --> 00:58:10.594
I was wondering, too.

00:58:10.618 --> 00:58:12.684
You look a bit upset.

00:58:12.708 --> 00:58:15.064
It is nothing. I just

00:58:15.088 --> 00:58:18.664
feel kind of sad.

00:58:18.688 --> 00:58:21.848
The female lead can't feel down.

00:58:25.148 --> 00:58:26.714
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

00:58:26.738 --> 00:58:30.194
<i>some couples start
off by hating each other.</i>

00:58:30.218 --> 00:58:33.098
<i>Let's lighten up the mood somehow.</i>

00:58:47.748 --> 00:58:52.048
Tonight, to your love and romance.

00:58:52.108 --> 00:58:55.184
Cheers to your beautiful eyes.

00:58:55.208 --> 00:58:57.858
<i>Nuts to that.</i>

00:58:59.788 --> 00:59:03.698
<i>I wondered why I was suddenly feeling hot.</i>

00:59:09.268 --> 00:59:11.334
Fire, fire, fire!

00:59:11.358 --> 00:59:12.884
- Maiden Sun Chaek!
- Fire!

00:59:12.908 --> 00:59:15.294
Get out, get out!

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:17.294
Hurry, hurry!

00:59:17.318 --> 00:59:19.128
Hurry!

00:59:25.378 --> 00:59:27.124
<i>My bomb shots</i>

00:59:27.148 --> 00:59:31.084
<i>became actual bombs.</i>

00:59:31.108 --> 00:59:33.118
Run away!

00:59:34.448 --> 00:59:36.554
Fire! Fire!

00:59:36.578 --> 00:59:38.284
Run! Get some water!

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.158
Fire! Fire!

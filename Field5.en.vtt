00:00:00.018 --> 00:00:25.594


00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.400
This is your doing.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
You're really amazing!

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
I... this song.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.599
I...

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800
I think that's the sense I meant.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.700
I like...

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
Hayakawa... you...

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.300
Um...

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.500
Are you serious?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.400
Are you serious?

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.000
So gross.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.000
Just kidding! I was messing with you.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.065
Because Kon-chan, you never
talk about girls at all.

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:11.751
I thought you might be into guys, but it
looks like that's not the case!

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:13.900
- No...
- I'm really sorry.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.200
I'm a pretty easygoing person
so I'll give anyone a quick kiss, really.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.481
I'll be more careful next time!

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:24.681
I'll head out first.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.900
Hey! Hayakawa.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
From this day on,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.600
Hayakawa never came to the rooftop again.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.700
"Depth of Field"

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.699
(Episode 5)

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.700
Konno.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.700
Hey! Konno.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.860
You're going to be late for class.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.986
Oh, right!

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:49.423
We're about to go take some photos for
our assignment. Do you want to come?

00:03:49.523 --> 00:03:51.400
Ah! I have to work today.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.944
- Is it at Tada-san's place?
- Yeah.

00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:56.500
Let's talk about it next time then...

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
I guess you can't really say that anymore.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.800
Yeah.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.500
Let's all get together again sometime!

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.600
Ryohei, you've really packed
your schedule with part-time jobs!

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.439
Is it really okay to just leave
your girlfriend hanging like that?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.585
We broke up a long time ago.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:26.921
Huh? When did that happen?

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.070
Is it that one? The girl you
dated back in junior high,

00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:32.321
the one you broke up with and
then got back together with, right?

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.948
How do you remember that so clearly?

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:34.760
What does it matter?

00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:38.268
- I just love hearing about relationship gossip.
- Wait, what? Relationship gossip?

00:04:38.368 --> 00:04:39.476
I want in on this too.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.900
Even Ume-san is joining in on the fun, give me a break!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.500
Hey, so why did you two break up?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.800
Is it because you're always too
busy playing with your camera?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.700
Hmm... Yeah, that was definitely
the case back in middle school.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.900
But... this time, it
feels a little different.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.960
Three years apart,
I'm sure we've both changed a lot.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.200
I see.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.666
See more, listen more, and experience more.

00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:10.500
For you,

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:13.600
this experience from high
school might have had a big impact.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.300
For just a casual chat while standing
around, this topic sure goes pretty deep.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.300
How about the three of
us go grab a drink later?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.739
I'm in.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.900
Let's go to that one! The
izakaya with island cuisine.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.155
- Not bad!
- Right?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.100
Hayakawa...

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.200
There's no need to escape
to the rooftop anymore.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.138
Oh right, I went to karaoke with Hayakawa
again yesterday, just the two of us.

00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:15.600
- Huh, really? Invite me too!
- For real.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.615
Let's all go together next time!

00:06:17.715 --> 00:06:18.608
What about today?

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:19.123
Today?

00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:19.815
Not today.

00:06:19.815 --> 00:06:20.508
Come on, let's go!

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:21.600
Singing karaoke today!

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.283
I can't make it today.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:23.717
I really can't do it!

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.717
Why, though?

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.000
And just like that, graduation arrived.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500
It's just...

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.700
That face of his,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.500
it's always been weighing on my mind.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.500
Cheers!

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.800
Drink up a little more!

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.200
Today's all about cheering
you up after your breakup.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.700
I told you, that was a long time ago.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.300
Hey, Ryohei! Now that you're single,
how about giving it a shot with me?

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.500
Ume-chan, you sure are straightforward!

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.400
Ume-san, the person
you like isn't me, right?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.743
Ah! I've been found out.

00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:35.744
Huh?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.867
Could it be that Ume-chan
has someone he likes?

00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:39.976
Who is it? Who is it?

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.300
It's nothing!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.500
Alright then... I'll just ask straight out.
Ume-chan, do you like guys?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.886
Because you joke around like that with both
guys and girls, it really makes me curious.

00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:55.598
Do you actually like boys or girls?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.600
Hmm... Do I really have to decide?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.581
It doesn't really matter whether
you like guys or girls, right?

00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:10.417
If I fall for someone of the
opposite sex, then I'm straight.

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:12.574
If it's someone of the
same sex, then I'm gay.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.300
As long as I meet someone amazing,
I can go with whatever their gender is.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.500
Ume-san.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.100
You're amazing.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.779
Let's give dating a try!

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.019
No, that's not it! What I mean is...

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.400
Hey! So, what does that mean...?

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.272
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:42.273 --> 00:08:44.912
What are the chances we
could actually start dating?

00:08:44.913 --> 00:08:45.913
Zero.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.200
That was a lightning-fast answer!

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.206
So delicious!

00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:52.865
Thank you for hosting me today.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.600
We can still go for another round!

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.386
- Hold on, I want to take some photos around here.
- Still as dedicated as ever!

00:09:03.886 --> 00:09:06.526
After all, I won't be able to
capture this view again for a while.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.900
Ryohei.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.700
Don't just take pictures of the scenery all the
time, try shooting people once in a while, too!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.504
You have to focus on the
ever-changing hearts of people.

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:24.286
It's tough, but that's exactly
what makes it so interesting.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.200
Yeah... I get that too.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.820
Is there something that's
been weighing on your mind?

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200
No, not really...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
There's a pretty good
photography gig this time.

00:09:39.873 --> 00:09:41.800
I've also invited Minami.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.340
If you're interested, would
you like to come along?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.767
This is my first time shooting a concert.

00:10:26.768 --> 00:10:28.800
Thank you so much for the invitation.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.249
Even though they're an indie
band, they seem to be pretty popular.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.947
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.

00:10:34.847 --> 00:10:36.500
Ah! Konno will be coming too, right?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.800
Hmm... I just thought it would be a
good experience for him, so I invited him.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.400
But it seems like he's not really
interested. He probably overslept.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.640
With his personality, it really
wouldn't be surprising if he overslept!

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.380
Why not try shooting some
portraits once in a while?

00:12:18.376 --> 00:12:20.035
Excuse me, can I still go in now?

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.700
I'm Konno, here for photography.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.500
Let me check, please wait a moment.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.100
What's your connection to this band?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.000
A photographer friend of mine
knows the bassist in the band.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.300
Tada-san.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.577
What's wrong?

00:14:27.777 --> 00:14:29.537
Even though it's a
bit late to say this now.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.600
But it's not my first time meeting
the band's lead singer, Hayakawa.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400
Huh?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.179
Great job.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.512
Thanks for helping out with the filming.

00:14:40.536 --> 00:14:41.983
No worries, you worked hard too!

00:14:42.008 --> 00:14:44.222
Sorry, I just couldn't find the place,
so we had to come to my place instead.

00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:45.949
Really sorry about that.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.200
Hello.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400
Good night.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.500
Kon-chan...

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.800
I didn't expect Hayakawa and
Konno-kun to be classmates.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.203
Seriously, they say it's a small
world, but this is just unbelievable!

00:15:05.228 --> 00:15:06.200
Yeah, it really is!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.660
It's not often we get this chance.
Please tell me your contact information.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.813
I might have to trouble you with
a lot more things in the future.

00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:16.000
Of course, no problem.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.000
Thank you.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.300
Alright, it worked.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.700
Does Hayakawa know?

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.900
No, I don't know.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.585
What's wrong?

00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.400
Aren't you two pretty close?

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.120
Well... I still have work,
so I have to head out first.

00:15:47.144 --> 00:15:48.389
Leaving so soon?

00:15:48.689 --> 00:15:51.500
I'll let you young folks have your fun.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.866
Great job! See you!

00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:53.906
I'll walk you out.

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:54.907
Thank you.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.487
You guys did great.

00:15:58.488 --> 00:15:59.574
That was absolutely amazing.

00:15:59.575 --> 00:16:00.575
That's great!

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.400
I watched the concert.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500
Yeah.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.400
You've really stuck with it.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600
You too.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.400
You haven't changed a bit.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.000
You cut your hair short.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.039
Because it's easier to wash my hair.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.200
- So why did you keep it long before?
- Because getting a haircut was a hassle.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.500
That's such a Konno answer.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.899
Thanks for waiting.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.342
- Konno, do you drink alcohol?
- Oh! I do.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.500
Then let's drink to our heart's content.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.900
Even though Tada-san is treating us.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.244
If you miss the last train, just stay over!

00:17:40.245 --> 00:17:42.126
But this is my place!

00:17:42.226 --> 00:17:43.226
Is that not okay?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.337
It's not like it's impossible...

00:17:46.338 --> 00:17:48.328
Alright, it's settled then!

00:17:48.528 --> 00:17:50.962
Cheers!

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.908
When did you start
getting into photography?

00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:54.949
I'm going to the restroom.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.255
Huh?

00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:57.736
What do you usually take pictures of?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.329
What?

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.135
What do you usually shoot?

00:18:02.136 --> 00:18:03.779
Playground equipment on campus.

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:04.979
Playground equipment?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.367
By the way, how long has
your band been together?

00:18:33.367 --> 00:18:38.566
This three-member lineup has been
together for a little over two years now.

00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:44.121
He originally played with Iriya, the
drummer, but Iriya isn't here today.

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:49.700
Later, we were looking for a vocalist who
could also play guitar, and we met Hayakawa.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.250
Even though I'm the band leader, he's the
one who really takes charge of composing.

00:18:56.617 --> 00:19:00.016
I guess you could say we just follow
the direction Hayakawa wants to go.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500
Oh, really?

00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:06.499
What was he like in high school?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.500
He doesn't really talk to me much. Did he ever sing
at events like the school festival or anything?

00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:16.192
Ah... Even though he never really
did anything that showey,

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.100
I think.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.500
He faces music and himself
with complete honesty.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.100
All I know is that lately,
Hayakawa feels full of freshness.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.700
On the other hand,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.600
I have absolutely no idea what
Hayakawa has been like lately.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.500
Sorry, did I wake you?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.100
Where did you just go?

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.480
I went to the convenience store for a bit.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.400
You took that long to buy something!

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.500
I've always... been bothered by something.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.300
The reason you stopped
coming to the rooftop.

00:21:01.273 --> 00:21:03.900
Think about your reason
for staying there, Hayakawa.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.500
I just feel like that's
not really a bad thing.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.300
But...

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.600
I've always had it on my mind.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200
Hayakawa.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.340
Was what you said back then really a lie?

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200
I...

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.300
I think that's what I meant.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.300
I like Kon-chan.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:53.922
What happened back then...

00:21:53.923 --> 00:21:56.300
If it wasn't a lie, would
you seriously consider it?

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.100
You go to bed first! I'm
going to take a shower.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
Hayakawa.

00:22:12.892 --> 00:22:14.292
It's really great to see you again.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.100
There's a side of Hayakawa
I don't know over there.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.300
It feels like I've seen how much he's
grown and changed over these three years.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.100
What are you laughing at?

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.100
It's nothing.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.000
Hey! I have a small favor to ask you.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.011
The lead singer of that band
last time is your friend, right?

00:23:47.311 --> 00:23:48.400
Yeah.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.000
I want to see that person one more time.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.900
What?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.200
No matter what, I just want
to see him one more time.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.509
(Final Episode)
I've always wanted to talk to you again.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.453
I thought I had to keep it hidden.

00:24:17.454 --> 00:24:21.133
Is this just the kind of affection you have
for a friend? Or is it something more...?

00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:23.576
Maybe it's just an illusion
from being apart for so long.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
No turning back.

00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:27.200
Konno has already gone to New York.

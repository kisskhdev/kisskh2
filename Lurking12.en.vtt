00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.439
Who's there?

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:42.079
You...

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.520
Who are you?

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.399
Speak, or I'll call for help.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.119
Mr. Song,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.039
I'm sorry.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:57.000
Get out.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.799
Okay.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.600
Sorry, Mr. Song.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.240
Please carry on.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.519
Dr. Gu,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.120
why did you come to the warehouse?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.840
I was lost.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.439
You were?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.560
Do you think I'll buy it?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.319
Suit yourself.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.799
Did I say you could go?

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:30.799
Let me go!

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.359
Stop.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.239
Stop.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.519
It was you.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.200
The one in the dean's office that night

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.159
was you.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.319
What are you talking about?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.719
(He's the one who killed the dean.)

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.400
Let go of me!

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.040
Stop.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.719
(I couldn't have misheard.)

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.199
(It was his voice.)

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.199
I've arrived.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.199
Where are you?

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.840
What do you want?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.680
I suggest you leave immediately.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.800
My friend called the police.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.039
Stop talking with her.

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.000
Take her back first.

How did you find me?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.080
I was passing by.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.319
Passing by?

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.360
Or was it premeditated?

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.240
What?

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.120
You suspect I'm with them?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.840
Song Qian, who exactly are you?

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.439
Do you still suspect I'm that K?

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.360
I've said it.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.120
I'm not him.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.719
I know in the dean's office that night,

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.000
it was you who held me hostage.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.680
I advise you
to confess everything to the police.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.599
I don't care what

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.000
makes you think I killed the dean.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.399
If you have evidence,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.040
just take it to the police.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.879
What are you doing, Song Qian?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.560
Dr. Gu,

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.800
I don't know who you've offended.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.160
But here's my advice.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.519
Don't dig into some things.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.959
What happened tonight
should be your warning.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.920
No rescuer comes every time

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.199
you're in danger.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.800
(Someone of his status
wouldn't do it personally.)

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.920
(Then why was he at the scene?)

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:25.920
(But regardless,)

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.519
(tonight's attack on me)

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.879
(proves someone wants me
to stop investigating.)

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
If Song Qian did kill the dean,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.519
I'd be the eyewitness.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.759
Then why would he rescue me?

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.360
Sir,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.920
her phone only has

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.560
a few photos of Wei Group

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.920
and nothing else suspicious.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.000
Destroy the phone.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.720
And keep close watch on Gu Nian.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.040
Yes, Sir.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.120
But if she becomes suspicious of you,

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.000
what should I do?

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.959
Then eliminate her.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.879
Dr. Gu,

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:07.160
look at the mess you've made.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.240
Since yesterday,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.639
drugs from Wei Group
not yet approved for sale

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.600
are already being sold on the market.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.199
Impossible.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.040
I personally supervised every shipment.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.600
There couldn't have been leaks.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.959
It's not my problem.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.519
Nurse Lin can vouch for me.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.040
Dr. Gu, I was indeed present then.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.199
But I don't know
if there were any drug leaks.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.639
I just followed the trucks.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.639
I can't take responsibility for this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.439
You...

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.519
Dr. Gu,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.000
you're suspended pending investigation.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:45.000
Chief, you think I'm reselling drugs?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.240
You've been managing
this project from day one.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.639
Now that there's trouble,

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.800
the responsibility is definitely yours.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.399
I won't admit to something I didn't do.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.240
But I will get to the truth.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.600
Chief, please give me three days.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.839
If I can't find anything,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.199
I will resign voluntarily.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.439
Hello.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.199
I'd like to confirm

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.959
when Mr. Song can meet me.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.800
Dr. Gu, we've informed Mr. Song
on your behalf.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.040
But unfortunately,

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.800
Mr. Song said
he can't see you right now.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:26.199
Qian.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.160
Let's go eat.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.800
Okay.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.439
Don't worry, Miss Wei.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.800
She won't find any evidence.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.519
Soon she'll face disciplinary action
and dismissal from the hospital,

00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.800
or maybe even jail time.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.519
I accessed the Wei Group
and the hospital's surveillance.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:07.800
The hospital surveillance footage
has no blind spots.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.399
But Wei Group's footage...

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.560
Look.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.040
This drug delivery truck
was in a blind zone.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.160
This completely fails
to prove your innocence.

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:18.759
Wei Group seems fishy.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.319
This matter is serious, Nian.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.399
You might go to jail.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.399
The same method
was used to frame my mother.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:27.439
It's the same.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.800
No witnesses.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.600
No surveillance.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840
Is your mother's death

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.360
related to the Wei Group?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And the dean's death
might also be related to the Wei Group.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200
I know they were murdered,

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:47.159
but I have no evidence.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.399
One day,

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.759
we will uncover the truth.

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:58.679
Look here.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.639
This car never turned off its engine.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.120
Its dashcam must've recorded everything.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.440
This license plate looks familiar.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.960
Likely Wei Group's top executives'.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.000
But this parking lot requires
official documentation for entry.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.440
How do we get the documentation?

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.320
Nian, there's always a solution.

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:23.919
Guess I'll have
to trade on my good looks.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:40.240
Sir.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.159
Miss, are you okay?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.879
Can you help me up, please?

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:43.759
I sprained my ankle.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:45.320
Are you okay?

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:06.759
(This license plate...)

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.440
(There.)

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:15.240
Who is it?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.759
Excuse me.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:19.519
Let me hide here.

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:30.399
Dr. Gu,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.120
this is trespassing.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.519
I can call the police on you.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.679

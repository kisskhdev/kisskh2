00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.804
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:57.683
Dong-ju!

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.744
This is great.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.370
You bastard!

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:34.053
I told you.

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.138
I used to be a champion.

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:45.439
I was right.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:48.901
This bastard can't see anything.

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:52.947
Didn't I tell you
to watch your blood pressure?

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:57.701
Serves you right for not taking
your coach's words seriously.

00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:01.997
How do you expect to fight me
in that state?

00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:29.066
I can beat you no problem
even with my eyes closed.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:42.246
VICTORY GYM

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.289
Take it easy!

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.207
I'm bouncing around, damn it.

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:30.544
Why are you walking?

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:33.589
Go faster!
Do you want me to bleed out to death?

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.301
It was a rubber bullet,
so you'll be okay, sir.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.261
Rubber, my ass.

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:40.429
Move carefully!

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.222
Open the ambulance doors!

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:44.600
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.354
Hey, be careful!

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:49.939
Watch it, you punks!

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:54.318
Didn't I tell you to call a helicopter?

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:56.445
Yoon Dong-ju.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:58.697
Yoon Dong-ju.

00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:01.700
What are you doing?

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.370
What happened to you?

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:05.537
What's going on--

00:04:06.497 --> 00:04:07.748
Yoon Dong-ju, what's wrong with you?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.832
-Dong-ju!
-Let go, bastard!

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:10.960
Hey, get a hold of yourself. Yoon Dong-ju!

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:12.711
Come on, snap out of it! It's me!

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:15.547
Look at me. Get it together, Yoon Dong-ju.

00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.225
Yoon Dong-ju.

00:04:37.528 --> 00:04:38.529
Jong-hyeon.

00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:41.657
Wait, you…

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:43.784
I…

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.705
I can't see anything.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:55.921
Yoon Dong-ju!

00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:13.105
Dong-ju.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:14.189
Dung-ju!

00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:18.360
Yoon Dong-ju!

00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:20.320
Jong-hyeon!

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.138
Let's go.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.984
Min Ju-yeong slipped out already.

00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:02.446
Where did the bastard run off to?
Did you run the plates?

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.074
They won't let us access
the CCTVs in the agency.

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:07.159
The agency is an absolute mess.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.245
Everyone's clueless and busy tiptoeing
around the commissioner.

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:12.706
And the commissioner
was harboring a criminal!

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.459
Shouldn't they investigate
the commissioner first?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.503
And who's going to do that?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.927
Forget it.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.054
You guys pull footage from nearby CCTVs

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.056
and trace the vehicle's movements.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.557
We'll go roughen up the commissioner.

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.059
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:34.812
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:37.815
Hey, Sergeant Kim. Did you find Dong-ju?

00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:43.737
Got it. Take him there for now.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.031
What's wrong with Dung-ju?

00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:47.950
He's not well.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.619
-What?
-Captain!

00:06:51.787 --> 00:06:53.038
I'll tell you later.

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:54.540
Senior Officer Ji!

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.208
Good work.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.002
Let's go see the commissioner. Come on.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.214
Have you seen Dong-ju or Jong-hyeon?

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.632
Oh, right. They're--

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:05.717
They're tracking down Min Ju-yeong

00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:07.261
-and went ahead.
-Right, they did.

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.805
-Come on. Let's go.
-They were super quick.

00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:12.349
I'm dying here.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.893
Come on. Hurry up.

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:17.020
Oh, my poor butt!

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.773
It hurts so much. Hurry it up already.

00:07:19.857 --> 00:07:21.316
Stop!

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.484
Excuse me.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.571
-What the heck?
-What are you doing?

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:30.409
Commissioner, where's Min Ju-yeong?
Tell us where he went.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.910
You know where he is, don't you?

00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:33.829
-What do you think you're--
-Stand back!

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:39.293
Sir, we have a shitstorm at our hands.
Are you not going to do anything?

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.712
You're the damn police commissioner!

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.382
What? "Damn police commissioner"?

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.301
You spineless weasel.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.053
You took the role,
but you've been completely useless!

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.513
"Spineless weasel"?

00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:53.974
-You heard me!
-You bastard!

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.561
You and your team
won't get away with this.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.731
What kind of officer
shoots a commissioner in the ass?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.067
Where's Ji Han-na?

00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.403
Hey, Riot Police. Find her. Where is she?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.613
-Move!
-Where's Ji Han-na?

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:08.822
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:10.574
Come on. Get moving.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.452
-Aren't you ashamed? Aren't you officers?
-Please leave.

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:15.120
What are you all doing? Get rid of him!

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:16.872
-Block him.
-You should be ashamed!

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:17.998
POLICE

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.499
It's a damn disgrace

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.335
to be part of the Korean police!

00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:33.055
Where are we going?

00:08:35.474 --> 00:08:36.475
Where's Min Ju-yeong?

00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:39.645
Min Ju-yeong isn't the issue right now.

00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:41.980
Just focus on yourself.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.663
INSUNG SEONGSIM HOSPITAL

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.123
Why are we here?

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.708
Go get an in-depth examination.

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:04.628
The doctor who helped you before
is waiting inside.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.923
She knows about your situation,
so she'll handle things discreetly.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.884
I'll explain things to Han-na.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.220
Forget it. I don't need to get examined.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:17.474
Are you afraid?

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.851
Why would I be afraid?

00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:23.772
You know better than anyone
how dangerous it is to be punch-drunk.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.242
Want me to hold your hand?

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.452
I'm not a kid.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:30.672
Jong-hyeon.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:35.969
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.559
She's calling you.

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:44.853
Please come in.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:10:59.618
Thanks.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.830
For looking out for me.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.126
You must be really unwell. Go inside.

00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:14.299
Don't smile. I don't want to
grow attached to you.

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.314
JONG-HYEON

00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:34.486
The person you are calling
cannot be reached.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.446
You will be directed to voicemail.

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.533
At around 2:20 a.m. today,

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:42.077
gunshots were fired
at the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.746
According to reports,
several suspects who had fled

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.416
during a recent crackdown
on illegal weapons and drug cartels

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.917
infiltrated the agency

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.962
and attempted to assassinate
Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.089
That awful man.

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:55.382
Serves him right.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.427
Why are you out so late these days?

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.430
With so many violent people
causing trouble,

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:05.392
I felt my heart drop
just from watching that news clip before.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.769
Don't do anything
dangerous like that again.

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:10.355
Take orders from above,
but be smart about it.

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:11.606
Okay, I'll be careful.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.693
Where's Dung-ju?

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.779
Oh, my husband took him to the vet.

00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:18.905
Is he sick?

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:21.825
I don't know.
They have to run some tests to find out.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.411
He looks strong and healthy,

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:25.787
but he worries me sick.

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:38.675
INSUNG REDEVELOPMENT SHOOTOUT SUSPECT
BREAKS INTO POLICE AGENCY…

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:42.179
Jeez, he's snoring like a chain saw.

00:12:44.181 --> 00:12:46.349
Don't take it out on the pillow.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:49.895
Man-sik, why do you keep sleeping here
instead of in your own home?

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.272
Going home will just stress me out more.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.941
INSUNG POLICE COMMISSIONER TARGETED…
COMMISSIONER CHO NOW IN EMERGENCY SURGERY

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:57.986
I'm flying out today. We need to talk.

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.033
Dong-ju's okay.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.285
Don't worry. I made sure he got examined.

00:13:05.368 --> 00:13:06.661
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:20.800
Mayor Roh.

00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.553
What did I just tell you?

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.599
You said a ship will arrive

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.060
from Japan tomorrow night.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.144
Exactly.

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:35.190
I told you we need to
load the goods on board and set sail.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:38.652
Just let me get on that ship and leave.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.278
I'll…

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.657
I'll do whatever I can

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.825
to make that happen.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.918
Your survival depends on my survival.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:13:59.756
Thanks.

00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:07.472
Would you rather we die together…

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:12.519
along with your son,
your daughter-in-law, and your grandson?

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:13.645
No.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:16.690
Look, I'll make it happen.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:17.691
You can go now.

00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:19.109
Thank you.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.913
The ship departed Japan.

00:14:31.997 --> 00:14:35.000
We have to move quickly
and secure the Candy for the deal.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.962
If the deal falls through again,

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.965
the Japanese won't just let it slide.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.802
We'll have to retrieve the goods
that Mr. Baek took then.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.647
Even the Buk-dong and Black Dragon guys?

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.941
They won't take Mr. Min's goods.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.570
Those dumb cowards.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.407
I think Mr. Min is looking for us.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.034
What should we do?

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.370
Who the hell is it?

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.791
What is this idiot saying?

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.168
"Friend"?

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.545
I may not be fluent in English,
but I do know that word.

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:22.797
We're not friends.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.471
Gosh, Mr. Min.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.391
I thought you were dead,
but you're alive and well.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.268
What's wrong?

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:37.395
Are you disappointed?

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.650
Of course not. You've got it all wrong.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.193
Then what's with the look on your face?

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.778
It's as if you were caught stealing.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:49.032
Stealing? What do you mean?

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.160
I think those belong to me.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:58.792
How are those all yours?

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:01.419
What about the price for my men's blood?

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.714
Now that Drugmon
and the Black Cat bastard are dead,

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.218
why don't we survivors split it?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.136
Fairly.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.058
What do you say?

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:20.605
Sounds good.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:22.482
Let's do that.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:23.817
We'll play it fair…

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.820
and let the survivor take it all.

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:29.823
Fuck you.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.867
Min Ju-yeong, you son of a bitch!

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.712
Yes, Captain.

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.172
I just got word.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:47.757
Yes.

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.259
I'll go straight to the scene.

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.469
Dong-ju?

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:55.598
He got examined until dawn,
so he should be sleeping…

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.951
Hey, did you miss me?

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.661
You grew so much.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:18.872
You little cutie.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.957
What are you doing here?
You didn't even check my text.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.061
Sorry.

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.105
My phone got busted.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.027
Are you coming back
from tracking Min Ju-yeong?

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.713
I missed you.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.489
Goodness, how sweet.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.032
You're back.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.284
You look great together.
What a good-looking pair.

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.369
Thank you, ma'am.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.622
Let's go.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.335
DUNG-JU

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.962
Hey, there he is.

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:54.133
-Hey.
-Dung-ju, come over here.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:18:59.597
Hey.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:06.104
You should've stayed in the hospital.
Why did you come here?

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.399
I can work and get treatment
at the same time.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.609
If you stop me, I won't get treatment.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:14.112
If anything happens to me,
it'll be your fault.

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.738
What kind of crap is that?

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.365
You're still wanted!

00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.826
Han-na, the crime scene is over there.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.997
What if other cops see you?

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:27.667
I've already confirmed that only the RIU
and the forensics team are here.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:30.253
Besides, nobody will notice me
in this situation.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.213
You and that smart mouth of yours.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.381
Why won't you listen to me?

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:34.340
Hey, Dong-ju.

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:37.093
-Hey.
-Are you okay? What did the doctor say?

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.595
The doctor? Why? Is someone sick?

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.471
Is it Ha-min, Ha-jun, Ha-yul, or Ha-yeong?

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.265
What are you talking about?

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:45.184
Dong-ju slept with me.

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:47.729
In separate rooms.

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:52.358
Oh, right. My wife is sick.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.944
-How sick is she?
-Come on, she wouldn't have noticed.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.946
Yeah, it was. Come on, Jae-hong.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.032
I smoothly changed the subject to my wife.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.745
Hey, you guys go on ahead.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.663
-Okay.
-We'll start the car.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.672
EVIDENCE: SUNFLOWER SEED SHELLS

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.633
Where's Baek Seok-chun?

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:18.760
There's no body, so he probably escaped.

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:21.679
The locals heard gunshots

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.723
and saw some Russians and Min Ju-yeong.

00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:25.433
But we don't know
where they disappeared to.

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:27.644
We checked all the footage
starting from the agency,

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.687
but we have no idea how they got here.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.899
Wait. That's strange.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.442
What do you mean?

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.278
Well, to get anywhere else from here,

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.989
he would've had to get past
seven checkpoints set up along the way.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:41.824
So how did he manage to avoid them all?

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.661
You're right.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.454
It means someone inside the force

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:49.123
is continuing to help Min Ju-yeong.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:52.794
So there's another rat
in addition to your rookie.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.630
Yes. But I don't think it was our rookie.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:58.549
This is an agency-issued
.38 caliber handgun.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.344
The grip here matches his wound exactly.

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:05.306
Wait. Are you saying the killer is a cop?

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.766
It looks like it.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.977
We looked into our rookie,

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.728
but nothing connected him to Min Ju-yeong.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:12.647
If the rat is a cop,

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.691
maybe they silenced your rookie
after getting caught.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.485
I'm ashamed to say this,
but one thing's clear.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.279
That rat is on our team.

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:37.422
If Min Ju-yeong escaped
while evading the patrols and checkpoints,

00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:39.424
he probably headed west.

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:43.261
Assuming he hasn't left Insung City,

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:45.847
the likely places where he could be hiding

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.100
can be narrowed down
to Seo-gu, Daejeong-gu, and Hoeun-gu.

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:50.852
This is the list of people who attended

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.812
the special joint task force
launch ceremony.

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.313
The majority of the attendees

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:56.691
will be connected to Min Ju-yeong
in some shape or form.

00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:59.694
Some on this list must own buildings

00:21:59.777 --> 00:22:01.529
in Seo-gu, Daejeong-gu, and Hoeun-gu.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:04.532
If we focus our efforts on that,
we'll catch Min Ju-yeong.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:07.577
Everyone who's anyone in Insung
is on this list.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.203
It might take some time,

00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:11.456
but let's see who owns buildings
in those areas

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.166
and look for Min Ju-yeong's hideout.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.459
Hey, someone's here.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.919
Now who's this?

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:20.339
I want people to leave, not show up.

00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:23.051
Goodness, everyone's all here.

00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:25.178
Even our fugitive.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:29.307
Not you.

00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:30.683
Why are you here?

00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:34.020
I thought you might want an update
on the commissioner.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.980
Why would I want an update

00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:38.316
unless he kicked the bucket
during surgery?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.693
He's fine.

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:45.198
By the way,
how did you manage to shoot him

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.241
without damaging a single nerve?

00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:49.702
Even the doctors were amazed.

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:51.454
You were a national athlete for a reason.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.749
Senior Office Ji is the best at shooting…

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:56.000
Sorry, sir.

00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:57.668
My apologies.

00:22:57.752 --> 00:23:01.047
You should've aimed for his butthole
while you were at it.

00:23:02.256 --> 00:23:05.259
I think the commissioner
has his own struggles.

00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:08.638
He said to cancel the APB on Yoon Dong-ju.

00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:13.768
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:23:13.851 --> 00:23:15.603
It means he won't get involved,

00:23:15.686 --> 00:23:18.523
but he'll turn a blind eye
to your efforts in catching Min Ju-yeong.

00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.733
But if things go wrong,
we'll end up taking the fall.

00:23:20.817 --> 00:23:23.611
What the heck is he up to?
It's like he's on the fence.

00:23:25.488 --> 00:23:27.865
I don't think Min Ju-yeong
and the commissioner

00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:30.284
are directly connected.

00:23:30.368 --> 00:23:34.539
But he can't step up because of the mayor
and other influential people involved.

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.791
So I tried to feel him out.

00:23:36.874 --> 00:23:38.835
I can't get involved.

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.461
What if something goes wrong?

00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:44.215
Who knows what that bastard
has in his arsenal?

00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.177
Don't forget

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:50.138
that money…

00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:55.059
isn't the only thing in my arsenal.

00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:58.146
Money isn't the only thing
in his arsenal, huh?

00:23:58.896 --> 00:23:59.981
If it's not money,

00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:03.734
then why is everyone
groveling to Min Ju-yeong?

00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:08.447
Min Ju-yeong is the type
to find someone's weakness

00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:09.991
and control them.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.744
He must have something big enough
to keep them powerless for so long.

00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:17.582
The people on this list

00:24:18.207 --> 00:24:21.752
mostly come from families
that made their fortunes through trade.

00:24:21.836 --> 00:24:23.546
Some still run their own companies

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:25.840
including the father
of the departmental chief prosecutor.

00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:30.511
This is the list of companies.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.722
Every company on this list

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:36.225
took off once Min Ju-yeong
started managing them.

00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:39.020
If you find out what he did back then,

00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:41.314
you'll find out the weaknesses
he has on them.

00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:44.400
Where did you get this from anyway?

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:48.070
Jeez, you think
I went on that business trip for fun?

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:50.114
Believe it or not,
I worked in intelligence.

00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:55.286
Min Ju-yeong was initially assigned
to the Information Management Division.

00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:58.623
He was in charge of managing
the integrated database.

00:24:59.207 --> 00:25:00.917
Integrated database?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.003
The Korea Customs Service
was transitioning to an electronic system.

00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:08.966
His job was to digitize paper records
and then destroy the documents.

00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:11.385
Documents, huh?

00:25:11.469 --> 00:25:12.720
What kind of documents?

00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:27.735
IMPORT TAX INVOICE (CUSTOMS COPY)
COMPANY NAME: CHEONGIL SHIPPING

00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.493
IMPORT TAX INVOICE (CUSTOMS COPY)
COMPANY NAME: CHEONGIL SHIPPING

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.496
Mr. Lee Jin-su
was in charge of Cheongil Shipping.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:40.706
Could that be connected as well?

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.208
Now that I think about it,

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:44.126
Cheongil Shipping was audited

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.797
for fraudulent tax invoices
shortly before its bankruptcy.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.090
Hold on, I just saw it.

00:25:54.262 --> 00:25:55.429
Right here.

00:25:56.514 --> 00:25:59.850
It says here an insider tip
triggered an investigation.

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:04.605
If the insider had been Min Ju-yeong…

00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:08.192
He must've found
the fraudulent tax invoices

00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:09.944
before the system went digital.

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:13.906
One of the invoices
must've been Cheongil Shipping's.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.700
I see.

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:17.243
Now it all makes sense.

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:19.996
He hit the jackpot with those documents.

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:25.209
He used those documents
to blackmail companies for bribes

00:26:25.793 --> 00:26:26.961
and to build a network.

00:26:28.504 --> 00:26:30.214
With powerful connections backing him,

00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:32.091
he lost his head.

00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:34.468
I told you that I don't know!

00:26:34.552 --> 00:26:37.138
Why are you asking me
about Oh Dollar's whereabouts?

00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:40.266
He took out Oh Dollar and tricked Leo…

00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:43.728
into wiping out all the other gangs.

00:26:48.733 --> 00:26:49.817
GWANGHO LOGISTICS
2025 TAX INVOICE

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.111
So Min Ju-yeong slowly took over Insung

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.572
by using the documents he had gathered.

00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:58.367
With that kind of leash in his grip,

00:26:58.451 --> 00:26:59.744
he had nothing to fear.

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:01.996
Get hold of those documents,

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:04.790
and we can wipe out
decades-old scums of Insung

00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:06.334
in a single blow.

00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:08.586
And where are we to go look for them?

00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:10.421
All the containers like the last time?

00:27:10.504 --> 00:27:12.006
I doubt they're there.

00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:15.551
He would've hidden such valuable material
somewhere more secure.

00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:18.721
If he had hidden them in containers,
we would've found them already.

00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:21.557
We had searched
every possible container at the time.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.768
Let's just ask one person

00:27:25.186 --> 00:27:26.395
who knows where they are.

00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:28.022
Who?

00:27:30.775 --> 00:27:31.901
Min Ju-yeong.

00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.115
We'll bait him

00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:40.701
by letting it slip

00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:43.120
where we'll strike.

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:45.414
How?

00:27:49.043 --> 00:27:50.461
Let's take care of the RIU first.

00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:53.422
The SCIT will handle the north side.

00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:56.258
The RIU can conduct
a thorough search of the south side.

00:27:57.343 --> 00:28:00.262
We have to move
as discreetly and quietly as possible.

00:28:00.346 --> 00:28:01.847
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

00:28:01.931 --> 00:28:04.183
If Min Ju-yeong catches on,
it'll be all for nothing.

00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:07.478
This is our last chance
to catch the bastard.

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:08.771
Do you understand?

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:10.356
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.111
Please refrain from using your phones.

00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:19.031
We'll communicate with these.
Set it to channel four.

00:28:20.783 --> 00:28:21.992
Here.

00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:24.912
Channel four!

00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:26.497
Yes, sir.

00:28:39.135 --> 00:28:42.138
Let's use the RIU's informant
like Dong-ju suggested.

00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:46.058
Right now, we can't trust anyone.
Not even Dae-yong.

00:28:48.602 --> 00:28:49.603
Okay.

00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:53.607
-Okay. Let's move.
-Yes, sir.

00:29:03.868 --> 00:29:05.369
This works, right?

00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:12.543
It might look like junk,
but the CIA used this in the past.

00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:15.004
It works perfectly fine
across a wide listening range.

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:17.423
And with my skillful touch…

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:18.591
Do you actually hear anything?

00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:22.136
And with my skillful touch…

00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:27.433
All he's doing is touching it.

00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:34.106
-Hold it up straight!
-Damn it.

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:36.317
Do it yourself then.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.903
I can't pick up the frequency!

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:42.072
Put that down.

00:29:43.407 --> 00:29:44.992
It's perfectly set up here!

00:29:45.075 --> 00:29:47.745
That punk has no redeeming qualities.
He falls short across the board!

00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:55.169
-No sign of him at the intersection.
-With my skillful touch…

00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:56.962
All of you need to get it together.

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:58.464
-Stop embarrassing the RIU.
-My skillful touch…

00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:00.007
What are we even doing?

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.550
-Can we catch Min Ju-yeong this way?
-My skillful touch…

00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:04.220
Beats me.
Let's just do what they say for now.

00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:06.138
It isn't you, Captain, is it?

00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:08.140
-Jeez, which bastard is it?
-With my skillful touch…

00:30:08.224 --> 00:30:10.518
I think Go Man-sik is suspecting me.

00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:12.811
I need a smoke. I'll be right back.

00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:14.104
All that touching and nothing.

00:30:14.188 --> 00:30:15.898
-Jeez, I'm exhausted.
-Okay.

00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:27.034
All of my hard work has paid off.

00:30:27.117 --> 00:30:28.452
I think one of them is on the phone.

00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:33.958
Can you hear me?

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:37.670
I'm not sure, but I think
they're looking for you, Mr. Min.

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:39.338
So we're all on a stakeout.

00:30:40.381 --> 00:30:42.466
I'll help you
once you decide on your destination.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.301
Also,

00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:47.221
I'll only help
once the money's been wired.

00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:50.432
I need your word on that.

00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:52.643
At least it's not Dae-yong.

00:30:57.273 --> 00:30:58.274
AN DAE-YONG

00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:09.410
-You bastard.
-What's going on?

00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:11.537
-Don't act like you don't know.
-What is it?

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.372
Are you serious, you bastard?

00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:15.040
-You asshole!
-Out of the way!

00:31:15.124 --> 00:31:16.375
You son of a bitch!

00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:17.918
Kick his ass over there!

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.213
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:23.465
-You know damn well, asshole!
-Captain.

00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:26.760
What's your problem?

00:31:26.844 --> 00:31:28.095
-What is this?
-Let go of me!

00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:29.597
What are you doing with my phone?

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.015
Where's your burner phone?

00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:33.601
What burner phone?
What the hell are you talking about?

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.103
Why are you searching the van? Get out.

00:31:37.354 --> 00:31:39.398
We know everything, you little shit.

00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:42.067
We heard you talking to Min Ju-yeong!

00:31:42.985 --> 00:31:44.695
What the hell are you talking about?

00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:48.073
Why would I talk to Min Ju-yeong?

00:31:48.157 --> 00:31:49.742
What's the matter with all of you?

00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:56.206
Then what's this?

00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:01.962
What did Min Ju-yeong tell you?

00:32:05.674 --> 00:32:07.843
-Talk!
-He…

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.261
He didn't say anything.

00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:10.763
You bastard!

00:32:10.846 --> 00:32:12.264
I'm telling the truth.

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:15.643
He said he got it and would call me back,
then hung up.

00:32:16.226 --> 00:32:17.895
How long have you been his mole?

00:32:18.812 --> 00:32:20.397
It hasn't been long. I swear.

00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:22.524
What the hell did you tell him?

00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:25.569
All I did was pass on what I knew
about the recent investigation.

00:32:26.737 --> 00:32:27.738
Hello?

00:32:28.322 --> 00:32:29.740
Are you okay, sir?

00:32:29.823 --> 00:32:31.992
It seems that the SCIT requested backup,

00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:33.702
so I wanted to see if things were okay.

00:32:35.371 --> 00:32:36.288
Then…

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:41.543
why did you kill the rookie?

00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:45.089
You damn asshole!

00:32:50.928 --> 00:32:52.096
Answer me.

00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:56.225
Because he caught me.

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:57.309
Jong-hun.

00:32:59.853 --> 00:33:01.271
Do you have something to say?

00:33:02.606 --> 00:33:04.525
Let me explain. Come with me.

00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:06.026
Just tell me here.

00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:08.737
I said I'd explain. Let's talk over there.

00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:16.453
Are you even human, you asshole?

00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.043
Do you think Min Ju-yeong has caught on?

00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:26.547
Let's squeeze this punk for information.

00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:29.675
No, let's wait a bit longer.

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.386
He'll make a move first.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.930
How can you be so sure?

00:33:35.472 --> 00:33:37.766
He may have acted indifferently,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.436
but losing all his hidden cash
must've come as a shock.

00:33:42.438 --> 00:33:45.691
Once you've been hit,
even a fake jab will make you flinch.

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.579
I know he'll make a move.

00:34:07.796 --> 00:34:08.630
Answer it.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.842
This is the last thing you can do…

00:34:13.886 --> 00:34:14.928
for Jong-hun.

00:34:21.852 --> 00:34:22.770
Hello?

00:34:29.193 --> 00:34:30.569
RESTRICTED NUMBER

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.952
Make sure
the Gumyeon Intersection is clear.

00:34:39.787 --> 00:34:41.121
There'll be a truck too.

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:42.706
I'll check on it and get back to you.

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:56.386
What are you all waiting for?

00:34:58.222 --> 00:35:00.474
Is he really okay?
Did he hurt his head that badly?

00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:02.351
How did he get so smart overnight?
It's scaring me.

00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:03.602
Let's get going.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.333
Senior Officer Shin, are you ready?

00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:29.169
Min Ju-yeong will head toward Gumyeon-dong
through the Gumyeon Intersection.

00:35:29.253 --> 00:35:31.046
-Keep your eyes open.
-Got it.

00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:40.973
We'll clear the road for you. Don't worry.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.726
He's heading toward Insung Middle School.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:45.894
Should I dispatch a patrol car?

00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:47.020
Yeah.

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.606
Patrol car number seven, move in.

00:36:11.628 --> 00:36:12.629
Patrol, your role is over.

00:36:20.888 --> 00:36:21.972
The vehicle is on the move again.

00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:24.975
After taking a left
at the Jungang Intersection,

00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:27.269
they're headed toward
Insung Industrial Complex.

00:36:32.858 --> 00:36:34.902
The vehicles are entering
the Gumyeon-dong Underpass.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.115
Stop, Misha.

00:36:43.076 --> 00:36:44.620
Why aren't they coming out?

00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:50.042
Captain, they entered the underpass,
but the vehicles haven't exited yet.

00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:52.002
What do you mean they haven't exited?

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:54.338
Jae-hong, we're almost there.

00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:16.944
-Is he there?
-No.

00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:29.748
The bastard stole a car
and escaped through the opposite lane.

00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:31.625
Check the vehicles
that exited the underpass!

00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:34.711
Can we take a look at the vehicles
that exited the underpass?

00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:37.172
They're checking right now.

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.674
More importantly,

00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:41.093
-they abandoned the truck.
-So what?

00:37:42.386 --> 00:37:43.679
Captain.

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:46.848
What if Min Ju-yeong has no intention
of retrieving the documents?

00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:53.814
Destroy the documents right now.

00:37:58.527 --> 00:38:00.320
Take out every single page…

00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:03.240
and dispose of them all.

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:05.617
Where did he keep those documents?

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.205
Once you clear the underpass,

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:11.873
you can reach Unseon-dong in Yeonsang-gu

00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:15.127
or Geumjeong-dong, Chungmu-dong,
and Anseong-dong in Jeong-gu.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.878
Yeonsang-gu?

00:38:17.379 --> 00:38:22.092
Hold on. The mayor used to be
the head of that district.

00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:23.802
The district head?

00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:26.555
I used to live there!

00:38:26.638 --> 00:38:28.640
Good work. I'm proud of you.

00:38:28.724 --> 00:38:32.185
The mayor was born and raised there,
so he had it good for a long time.

00:38:34.104 --> 00:38:37.566
He'll need a space large enough
to store the documents he wants destroyed.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.570
A secure location that can preserve
documents for a long time.

00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:43.321
LIST OF BUILDINGS

00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:47.075
It's this one.

00:38:47.701 --> 00:38:49.619
You and I see eye to eye.

00:38:49.703 --> 00:38:51.204
I think so too.

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:56.168
When the mayor
took office as district head,

00:38:56.251 --> 00:38:57.794
the first project he pushed for

00:38:57.878 --> 00:38:59.963
was building
the Yeonsang-gu Public Library.

00:39:00.047 --> 00:39:02.007
It has an underground storage facility.

00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:05.052
-Freeze!
-This is the police. Stop immediately!

00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:08.096
-Leave it!
-Stop the paper shredder!

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.518
Don't move!

00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:18.982
So these are
the corruption-related documents, huh?

00:39:19.066 --> 00:39:22.277
Fortunately, they didn't destroy much.
The majority of them are still here.

00:39:22.903 --> 00:39:24.154
COMPANY NAME: TAE CORPORATION

00:39:24.237 --> 00:39:26.406
Oh, I found it.

00:39:26.907 --> 00:39:28.116
TAE Corporation.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:31.369
TAE CORPORATION
TAX INVOICES

00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:34.289
Right here.

00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:38.794
This reeks of corruption.

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:41.838
Let's go get him.

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:46.927
What happened?

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.805
-What did Commissioner Cho say?
-They didn't allow visitors to see him.

00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:52.557
Damn it, you bastard!

00:39:52.641 --> 00:39:55.102
So you just came back here empty-handed?

00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:58.105
You've got to be kidding me!

00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:00.023
I'm losing my mind here!

00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:03.026
And that bastard Cho Pan-yeol
won't answer my calls!

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.029
Don't just stand there.
Go get the car ready!

00:40:13.245 --> 00:40:14.663
Forward, march!

00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:19.459
Right flank, march!

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:24.756
He's going down the main staircase.
Stop him.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.299
I'm on my way up.

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:36.393
Damn it!

00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:54.244
Wow.

00:40:56.997 --> 00:40:58.748
-Halt!
-One, two!

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.297
That's all I know.

00:41:06.506 --> 00:41:09.718
But Min Ju-yeong was the one
who gave out the orders.

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:13.096
So you get what I'm saying, right?

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.766
There's a whole story behind this.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.185
I'm serious.

00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:25.066
-They're here.
-What do you mean?

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.736
Who's here? Cho Pan-yeol?

00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:29.946
Well, we got what we came for.

00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:35.202
-Let's wrap this up.
-Wrap what up?

00:41:35.285 --> 00:41:37.621
Jeez, what's the matter with you guys?

00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:38.997
Come on!

00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:45.086
No, don't do this!

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.463
Hey, call 112! Call the police!

00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:49.049
No, I meant 119!
The emergency response team!

00:41:49.132 --> 00:41:50.258
119, my ass.

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:52.844
Does the commissioner know
what you're doing?

00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:55.472
Where's Cho Pan-yeol? Bring him here!

00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:57.599
I already told you everything I know!

00:41:57.682 --> 00:42:00.143
I don't know Min Ju-yeong that well!

00:42:00.227 --> 00:42:01.895
Save your excuses for the reporters.

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:09.110
No, please stop!

00:42:09.194 --> 00:42:11.780
Don't do this!

00:42:19.246 --> 00:42:21.498
Come on, let's talk it out.

00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:23.875
The two of us can leave quietly.

00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:24.960
Goodbye.

00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:37.764
HAPPY INSUNG WITH CITIZENS

00:42:46.773 --> 00:42:48.191
Get away from me!

00:42:51.278 --> 00:42:53.029
Why are you doing this to me?

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:04.165
Jeez, you scared me!

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.501
He says he's not the mayor.

00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:08.420
If he's not the mayor, then who is?

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.261
Look at him spinning.

00:43:18.722 --> 00:43:20.265
He must be dizzy.

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:26.646
Authorities have confirmed Min,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.940
a former customs officer
involved in a recent drug smuggling case,

00:43:29.024 --> 00:43:31.443
had long been colluding
with Mayor Roh Deok-gyu

00:43:31.526 --> 00:43:34.404
and other high-ranking officials,

00:43:34.487 --> 00:43:36.072
causing widespread shock.

00:43:36.656 --> 00:43:39.242
Man, what a relief.

00:43:39.326 --> 00:43:40.577
Shall we eat now?

00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:45.540
My appetite is back.

00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:49.044
I'll go get some water.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.840
Yoon Dong-ju.

00:43:53.923 --> 00:43:55.091
Are you okay?

00:43:55.175 --> 00:43:57.510
Yeah, you don't look so well.

00:43:58.094 --> 00:44:00.388
Did you overdo it? You look drained.

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:06.186
Who, me? Of course not.

00:44:10.774 --> 00:44:12.609
The meat is so tender and good.

00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:14.944
-Ma'am, can we get more meat?
-Okay.

00:44:15.028 --> 00:44:16.446
-And more kimchi, please.
-Okay.

00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:19.240
-Hey.
-Oh.

00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:21.451
Thank you.

00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:25.038
Eat up.

00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:30.794
Where are Dong-ju and Jong-hyeon?

00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:31.920
They went to the restroom.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:51.689
Are you stupid?

00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:55.402
Don't push yourself.
It'll be more obvious if you do.

00:44:55.944 --> 00:44:57.779
I'm just dizzy because of my meds.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.031
I think that doctor's a quack.

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:03.284
Button up before Han-na sees you.

00:45:14.087 --> 00:45:15.130
What?

00:45:25.098 --> 00:45:26.099
What are you staring at?

00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:32.313
I guess I meant a lot to you.

00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:34.691
Stop talking nonsense.

00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:38.611
The captain filled me in.

00:45:41.781 --> 00:45:43.908
You should be grateful to Sergeant Kim
for the rest of your life.

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:47.579
I can't believe he sacrificed all that
for a mess like you.

00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:48.997
What are you talking about?

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.170
Sergeant Kim went so far

00:45:56.004 --> 00:45:58.006
as to give up all his shares to save you.

00:45:58.465 --> 00:45:59.299
Help us.

00:46:01.593 --> 00:46:02.594
I mean, I get it.

00:46:03.595 --> 00:46:06.222
I'm definitely charming enough

00:46:06.806 --> 00:46:08.099
to be worth your whole fortune.

00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:09.142
Yoon Dong-ju.

00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:13.021
Your meds are causing
some serious side effects.

00:46:23.156 --> 00:46:25.158
Answer it. It's the nursing home.

00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:29.704
Hello?

00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:03.613
I'm sorry.

00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:08.910
It's my fault that you got hurt.

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:12.497
I'm so sorry.

00:47:14.374 --> 00:47:15.542
Don't say that.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.420
You have nothing to be sorry about.

00:47:21.256 --> 00:47:22.966
I heard the whole story.

00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:27.303
Thank you, Dong-ju.

00:47:35.228 --> 00:47:36.229
What happened

00:47:37.522 --> 00:47:38.690
to your face?

00:47:39.732 --> 00:47:42.694
It's making me upset.

00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:52.537
You're like a son to me.

00:47:54.706 --> 00:47:56.624
I shouldn't have been so harsh on you.

00:47:58.501 --> 00:48:02.338
You must've been upset
when I said we shouldn't see each other.

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:05.925
It's okay.

00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:14.517
Dong-ju.

00:48:16.436 --> 00:48:17.437
Yes?

00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:19.814
From now on…

00:48:22.275 --> 00:48:26.154
let's live as mother and son.

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:28.823
Let's stay close

00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:33.077
and be there for each other, okay?

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.211
My dear Dong-ju.

00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.757
My son.

00:49:02.649 --> 00:49:04.108
Don't cry.

00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:06.944
I'm so sorry.

00:49:37.392 --> 00:49:39.268
The Japanese canceled the deal.

00:49:39.352 --> 00:49:42.647
They said penalty fees weren't necessary.

00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:49.112
That means they're going to kill me.

00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:51.155
What should we do with the Candy?

00:50:00.081 --> 00:50:03.084
He got mixed up with Min Ju-yeong
while taking bribes from businesses.

00:50:04.669 --> 00:50:07.672
Turns out, he had gambling debts
and even borrowed from loan sharks.

00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:15.888
Sergeant Kim.

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:18.766
You found Oh Jong-gu?

00:50:28.443 --> 00:50:30.111
Why are you getting in? Get out!

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:31.612
Where do you think you're going?

00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:33.239
We have to catch Min Ju-yeong.

00:50:34.449 --> 00:50:36.659
What are you doing? Let's move.

00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:41.289
Goodness gracious.

00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:50.214
We need to find something here
to figure out where Min Ju-yeong is.

00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:53.593
I'm going to the scene for a bit.

00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:55.052
Don't worry about things here.

00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:59.056
MOM

00:51:00.641 --> 00:51:01.851
Detective Lee, let's keep digging.

00:51:01.934 --> 00:51:04.729
Mom, I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later.

00:51:07.023 --> 00:51:08.024
What?

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.777
Why are you looking for Dong-ju?

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.905
I have to ask him something
about his insurance policy,

00:51:13.988 --> 00:51:16.073
but he won't answer his phone.

00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:18.826
By the way, what's wrong with him?
Is he sick?

00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:22.246
You're not seeing him, are you?

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.125
It's not a big deal.

00:51:28.044 --> 00:51:29.086
And Mom,

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:31.714
I'll handle my own business.

00:51:31.798 --> 00:51:33.174
Stay out of it.

00:51:35.426 --> 00:51:36.928
SAFETY IS OUR COMPANY'S TOP PRIORITY

00:51:42.058 --> 00:51:43.100
Did you catch him?

00:51:43.184 --> 00:51:46.395
No, but I think he's still here.
Let's split up and search for him.

00:51:48.022 --> 00:51:49.690
Hey, what are you doing?

00:51:49.774 --> 00:51:51.108
Don't do anything and stay put.

00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:53.528
What do you mean, Captain?

00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:54.779
-Let's go.
-Uncuff me!

00:51:54.862 --> 00:51:57.615
-Wait right here.
-Hey, Jae-hong!

00:51:57.698 --> 00:51:59.617
Kim Jong-hyeon! Captain!

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.828
You can't leave me here like this!

00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:03.496
We need to go together!

00:52:08.584 --> 00:52:09.794
Damn it.

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:24.600
Oh Jong-gu!

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:28.646
He's not here.

00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:30.898
Sergeant Kim.

00:52:30.982 --> 00:52:34.151
Dung-ju can't get those cuffs off, right?

00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:36.696
I'm positive that he can't get them off.

00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:40.658
Hey, Oh Jong-gu!

00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:50.126
Damn it.

00:52:59.427 --> 00:53:00.720
Where are you going?

00:53:01.596 --> 00:53:03.055
There's no way out now.

00:53:07.727 --> 00:53:09.145
What is it?

00:53:09.228 --> 00:53:10.813
Looks like you need another beating.

00:53:12.106 --> 00:53:13.649
Did you follow me because you want to die?

00:53:15.026 --> 00:53:16.027
No.

00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:17.945
I'm here to catch you.

00:54:03.032 --> 00:54:03.908
Hey.

00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:09.830
Thanks.

00:54:10.665 --> 00:54:12.291
This was pretty uncomfortable.

00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:15.419
Shall we start our rematch?

00:54:15.503 --> 00:54:17.046
Rematch?

00:54:24.845 --> 00:54:25.846
Come here.

00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:39.527
You trying to use your head, asshole?

00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:41.654
Are you trying to tire me out?

00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:42.905
Took you long enough to catch on.

00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:44.407
Guess you're not totally empty in there.

00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:47.994
To be honest,
you pack a pretty mean punch.

00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:53.791
Hey, focus.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.419
This is why you can't read
your opponent's movements.

00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:58.713
How dare you try to lecture me?

00:54:58.796 --> 00:55:00.297
Do I look like a joke to you?

00:55:01.173 --> 00:55:02.425
No.

00:55:02.508 --> 00:55:03.759
You look pathetic.

00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:06.512
What?

00:55:06.595 --> 00:55:08.305
I thought you were a cool athlete

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.475
when you were in the ring.

00:55:11.559 --> 00:55:15.229
You're the reason why
I ended up like this, you little shit.

00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:17.648
If you hadn't backed out of that contract,

00:55:17.732 --> 00:55:20.401
I wouldn't have become
Min Ju-yeong's lapdog.

00:55:21.027 --> 00:55:22.194
Don't blame other people.

00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:24.572
Blame your stupidity.

00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:26.866
What did you say?

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:28.200
That's what you told me

00:55:28.284 --> 00:55:30.119
when I lost at the national team trials.

00:55:30.745 --> 00:55:32.413
I didn't learn much from you,

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.707
but I do remember that much.

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:37.293
You arrogant little bastard.

00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:45.426
Damn it.

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:47.928
Go learn some more, asshole.
This is how you use your head.

00:56:07.198 --> 00:56:08.240
Get up.

00:56:25.216 --> 00:56:26.258
Now that I think about it,

00:56:26.842 --> 00:56:28.344
there's one more thing I remember.

00:56:30.763 --> 00:56:33.891
It's what you told me
every time I stepped in the ring.

00:56:36.352 --> 00:56:37.645
You said too much greed

00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:40.064
weighs down your punches.

00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:42.900
And if that happens,

00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:44.944
you're finished!

00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:02.002
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju!
I told you to stay in the car!

00:57:03.462 --> 00:57:04.463
What's this?

00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:09.135
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju!

00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:11.470
This little mutt just won't stay tied up.

00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:14.098
Oh, come on. I got Oh Jong-gu.

00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:15.516
Good for you, damn it!

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:18.352
Oh Jong-gu, you're under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act

00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:20.729
and for the illegal use
and sale of license plates.

00:57:20.813 --> 00:57:21.856
Senior Officer Ji!

00:57:29.155 --> 00:57:32.324
You also knew Dong-ju was unwell,
didn't you?

00:57:34.326 --> 00:57:35.828
You knew?

00:57:38.581 --> 00:57:41.584
-Has he gotten worse?
-Well, the thing is…

00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:44.170
He went to the hospital
with Sergeant Kim not long ago.

00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:50.259
-You all know Dong-ju shouldn't be here.
-But…

00:58:01.312 --> 00:58:02.146
Oh Jong-gu.

00:58:17.661 --> 00:58:18.662
Does it hurt?

00:58:19.288 --> 00:58:20.748
It doesn't hurt at all.

00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:21.874
See?

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:27.588
Oh Jong-gu has a really hard head.

00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:28.797
See? It does hurt.

00:58:28.881 --> 00:58:30.549
This is nothing.

00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:33.219
I'm okay. It's not a big deal.

00:58:33.928 --> 00:58:36.931
It might be a tiny hairline fracture,

00:58:37.556 --> 00:58:40.100
-but as long as I take care of it--
-It is a big deal!

00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:48.400
What's the matter?

00:58:49.735 --> 00:58:51.946
How long are you going to pretend
that you're fine in front of me?

00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:55.699
I told you to be honest
if you were hurting.

00:58:56.325 --> 00:58:58.869
Just lean on me
instead of struggling on your own!

00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:01.747
You're not alone anymore.

00:59:02.248 --> 00:59:04.750
I don't want you to be in pain,
so if you care about me…

00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:16.887
How long have you known?

00:59:17.513 --> 00:59:18.889
How could I not know?

00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:26.730
I waited until you were ready to tell me.

00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:31.151
I'm sorry.

00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:34.238
What are you sorry for?

00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:35.656
I'm the one who didn't tell you.

00:59:38.951 --> 00:59:40.744
I didn't want you
to see me sick and worry,

00:59:41.704 --> 00:59:43.122
so I kept it from you.

00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:46.292
I'm sorry.

00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:52.131
What now?

00:59:54.216 --> 00:59:55.301
Don't worry too much.

00:59:58.053 --> 00:59:59.221
You see,

00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.181
Kim Jong-hyeon

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:04.268
introduced me to a good doctor.

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:06.562
She said I'll get better
if I take my meds and get treated.

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.026
You'd better.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.862
If you don't, I'll kill you myself.

01:00:15.738 --> 01:00:17.781
From now on,
tell me if you feel even slightly off.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:20.159
Keep me posted on
your hospital visits and meds.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.536
Don't leave anything out, okay?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:23.954
Okay.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:28.000
Actually, I just took my meds
so I feel a bit dizzy.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.849
Are you feeling okay these days?

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.518
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.731
It's been a while since I took any meds.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:54.777
I must be your medicine.

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.489
I guess so.

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:00.240
I'm so glad.

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:03.535
I'm sorry, Han-na.

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:12.836
Give me your hand.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.131
Does it hurt?

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:17.966
No, it doesn't.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:28.435
-By the way…
-Yeah?

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:30.562
Can we do this?

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:36.235
Of course.

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.154
We totally can.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:47.955
RESTRICTED NUMBER

01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:08.642
Goddammit.

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:16.442
What about the goods?

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:32.458
This looks a bit different
from what you showed me before.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.626
Is it fake?

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.996
How much of this do you have?

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:18.128
A whole truckload.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:22.758
That's more than we can handle.

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:24.551
Money, you see.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.136
It's free.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.224
But I need a favor in return.

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.514
"A hazy fog rolls in."

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.683
"The street flows along."

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.687
"With no harbor to drop the anchor,

01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:21.900
I stand with my hands on the red postbox
on the street corner."

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:34.580
It's time for you to return my book.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.086
Min Ju-yeong.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:45.257
The bastard is crazier
than you can ever imagine.

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:48.343
He's never satisfied
unless he takes what he wants

01:04:48.427 --> 01:04:51.471
or destroys what he can't have.

01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.142
I can't say when he'll snap,

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:57.894
but now could be it
since he has nowhere to run.

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:01.857
Be careful.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:13.410
179-45, CHEONGMA 7 FACTORY,
CHEONGMA-DONG, YUWOL-GU

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:17.998
CAPTAIN GO MAN-SIK

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:20.959
Yes, Captain?

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:24.504
We got word that the truck carrying drugs
is heading toward Cheongma-dong.

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:26.173
Jae-hong and I are on our way.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.799
I'll join up with Jong-hyeon and go.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.058
Officer Yoon!

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:40.145
Officer Yoon, I'm here!

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:42.773
Car keys!

01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:44.483
Take her.

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:50.697
Han-na, are you on your way?

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.282
The truck might explode.

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:54.910
We have to stop it on the road
before it reaches Cheongma-dong.

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:56.703
-Okay.
-Got it.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.163
Everyone, be careful.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.490
Is it that truck?

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:37.035
It's the truck!

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.454
Is that Jong-hyeon?

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:48.088
Keep your cool.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:03.895
Hold on tight.

01:08:05.332 --> 01:08:06.166
Get out.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.417
Get out now.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.630
Damn it!

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.799
-Get the hell out!
-Screw you, you bastards!

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:16.384
Don't come near here!

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:36.404
You can look forward to it.

01:08:36.905 --> 01:08:40.116
Today is going to be a very memorable day.

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:23.493
What's Min Ju-yeong's next plan?

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:24.619
Choose your words wisely.

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.705
Who would help Min Ju-yeong?

01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:28.707
It's time. Keep an eye out.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.959
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.379
Dozens of high-ranking officials in Insung

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:37.090
have long been in cahoots
with Min Ju-yeong.

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:39.593
Do you think you can tackle it overnight?

01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:42.053
I'll give you a chance.

01:09:42.137 --> 01:09:43.680
We have to find him fast

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.724
before the bastard
throws another curveball.

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:48.727
When everyone burned with passion…

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:52.480
Move!

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:56.109
A scumbag like you
doesn't get to make excuses.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:01.114
Don't think it's all over
just because I'm gone.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.825
We were heroes.

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:09.039

[Episode 21]

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.850
So, you're the son of Grand Tutor Guo.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.640
Do you know how to play polo?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.330
No, I don't.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.570
That's quite a pity.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.510
Though I can't play polo,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.530
I've excelled at painting since childhood.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
I'd be honored...

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.480
to paint a polo match for Your Highness.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.080
That's actually a good idea.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.180
When the rain stops,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.920
I'll call them

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.050
to play polo with me.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.770
I'd like to see

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.410
how well you can paint.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.650
My painting...

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.860
will surely be passed down
through the ages.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.560
You're so arrogant.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.479
Do you think you're as good as Gu Kaizhi?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.310
Gu Kaizhi was merely

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.870
peerless in painting, unmatched in talent,
and utterly obsessed.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.560
I'm more versed in the classics
than he was.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.200
I can recite
the "Spring and Autumn Annals" backward.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.600
Does Your Highness doubt

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.170
that within 10 years...

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.620
my fame will surpass his?

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.570
That crazed scholar?

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.800
I remember now.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.229
He was the son
of the great Confucian Master Guo Yu.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.720
Yes.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.840
It was Guo Sigong

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.640
who presented a folding screen
to the Palace Secretariat,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.650
And upon that screen

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.740
was the painting
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal."

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.460
Liu,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.670
every time you come to see me,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.050
you stare at that screen in a daze.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.900
Could it be

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.780
that you and Guo Sigong

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.380
have some connection?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.500
Liu!

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.310
Take off your disguise!

Liu Zigui.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.370
Why did you do this?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.840
Did you kill all those people

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.850
in the painting?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.700
They deserved to die.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.410
Every single one of them deserved death!

It was a spring many years ago.

At that time,
the great Confucian Master Guo Yu

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.000

Your Highness.

If Your Highness finds the passage
in the Spring and Autumn Annals

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.030
about Shangchen murdering his father,
the emperor, too cruel

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.280
and unbearable to hear,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.520
then starting tomorrow,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.670
I will teach Your Highness

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.350

Why isn't he dead yet?

Wasn't the strychnine

supposed to have killed him already?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.710

The one fabricating stories

He told everything to my father.

And less than a year after

Emperor Xiaojing's death,

he died of depression.

And my father,

because of Emperor Xiaojing's death,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.800
lost his promising career.

Before he died,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.630
he told me the secret

of "The Lament of the Imperial Scandal"

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.560
and instructed me

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.720
Until Ma Meng...

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.360
rose from a mere

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.290
Hanzhou Judicial Advisor

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.510
to become Deputy Director
of the Palace Secretariat!

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.370
He's now a fourth-rank official.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.180
I both admired him

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.750
and felt a bit jealous.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.120
But more importantly,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.770
I saw an opportunity for revenge!

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.190
I sent Gulou Pastry

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.070
to those people while disguised as him—

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.600
who would refuse it?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.420
This must be His Majesty's kindness.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.780
Grand General,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.670
do you need me to spell it out?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.450
In that case,

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.000
many thanks to Secretariat Ma.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.120
The Ghost Market Magistrate Feng

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.190

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.900
Crown Prince Hong held his teacher Guo Yu

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.490
in the highest regard.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.650
The Crown Prince once

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.840
bestowed upon him the golden polo mallet

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.310
granted by Emperor Gaozong himself.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.190
What you're carrying now
is that very item, isn't it?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.310
Yes!

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.040
And so what?

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.620
I had planned to force

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.430
strychnine poison down Wei Yan's throat.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.830
Then, using the same method they used

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.630
to murder Emperor Xiaojing,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.210
I'd deal with him

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.470
just like the others!

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.480
Secretariat Ma...

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.920
Why?

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.600
Who are you, really?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.670
The golden mallet bestowed by His Majesty

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.720
didn't get to taste Tutu Wenzhen's blood.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.240
Though that old eunuch is dead,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.750
this still leaves me

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.130
like Duke Xiang of Song—defeated at Hong,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.600
filled only with regret.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.960
Stop desecrating
the "Spring and Autumn Annals" here!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.010
Do you know

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.120
who delivered the screen

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.510
painted with
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal"

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.260
to the Palace Secretariat?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.000
It was me,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.550
Tutu Wenzhen.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.030
You're still alive?

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.600
This old life of mine

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.390
isn't worth saving.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.150
What's truly regrettable is
that back then,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.330
I helped your father

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.040
deliver the screen
to the Palace Secretariat,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.000
yet it still didn't cure his madness.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.750
What did you say?

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.680
Attendant Tutu,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.750
you were my father's good friend.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.210
Please help me.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.320
It's not that I'm unwilling to help.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.850
But everyone knows you're ill,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.680
and I don't know

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.330
how best to help you.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.360
I have just completed a new painting

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.150
of Emperor Xiaojing playing polo,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.750
also titled
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal."

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.490
It's exquisite.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.550
Attendant Tutu, I only ask

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.150
that you help me
send it to the Palace Secretariat.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.000
I believe

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.760
once His Majesty sees it,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.030
he will surely be impressed by my talent.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.670
Then,

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.080
there will be hope for my official career.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.510
Fine.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.750
For your father's sake,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.830
I will help you.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.750
According to
the Ministry of Personnel's records,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.720
the court

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.410
no longer employed Guo Sigong

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.630
because he suffered from

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.790
severe delusions.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.340
Especially after Guo Yu's death,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.150
his condition worsened significantly.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.810
Therefore,

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.050
Guo Yu's so-called eyewitness account

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.270
of Crown Prince Hong's murder

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.790
must be Guo Sigong's delusion.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.580
Impossible!

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.550
I know!

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.590
Many street storytellers

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.270
often fabricate tales

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.840
about Crown Prince Hong's death,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.320
bewitching the common people.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.150
In their wild inventions,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.910
Empress Wu Zetian becomes
the mastermind behind it all.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.960
Some even dare

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.750
to slander Emperor Gaozong himself.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.600
And we, the former officials
of the Eastern Palace,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.800
become accomplices.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.800
Do you know

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.150
that after His Highness died,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.440
Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian
were extremely grief-stricken?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.100
Otherwise,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.270
why would they posthumously bestow
upon him the title Emperor Xiaojing

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.840
and have him buried with
the rites of an emperor

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.370
in the imperial mausoleum?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.070
I heard Emperor Gaozong say
with my own ears

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.270
that Crown Prince Hong's death
was a loss to the nation

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.150
and that the empire lost a wise ruler

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.150
and a polo champion!

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.440
When Emperor Gaozong said this,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.900
he was in tears.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080
This old man

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.440
still remembers it vividly to this day!

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.400
Impossible!

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.000
Impossible.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.770
You will never convince me!

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.800
My father was the most

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.470
excellent man in this world!

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.120
If Crown Prince Hong hadn't

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.320
been murdered by you,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.840
he could have at least become chancellor!

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.830
And I,

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.910
Guo Zigui,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.470
wouldn't be like I am now—

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.440
skilled in both civil and military arts,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.510
full of talent

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.310
yet unrecognized by anyone!

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.600
Wei Yan,

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.080
Tutu Wenzhen,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.410
you are the murderers.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.690
By Emperor Xiaojing's edict,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.510
I hereby take your lives!

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.510
This was bestowed by His Majesty.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.050
This was the treasure

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.140
granted to our Guo family
by Emperor Xiaojing himself!

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.150
I'll kill you!

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.910
No!

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.600
Stop!

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.090
Sheriff Wei.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.840
It seems that Guo Zigui

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.480
also suffers from madness.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.510
Although he has confessed his crimes,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.370
this case

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.750
involves many high-ranking court officials

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.280
and still requires a joint trial
by the Three Judicial Offices!

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.350
There is no need

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.050
for a joint trial for such a madman!

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.840
[The Lament of the Imperial Scandal]

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.320
His Majesty has ordered
the Palace Secretariat

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.650
to destroy this screen.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.670
I heard.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.080
Xijun thinks

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.910
it's a great pity.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.970
In terms of artistry alone,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.730
this painting is on par with
Gu Kaizhi's work.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.040
It would indeed be a shame to destroy it.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.880
Fortunately,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.670
Her Highness the Princess learned of this

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.870
and sent someone to request the screen.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.200
What does Her Highness want it for?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200
Her Highness said

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.960
she wishes to gaze upon the painting

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.670
to ease her longing for her elder brother.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.360
When Emperor Xiaojing passed away,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.720
Her Highness was only 10 years old.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.840
It's said they had
a very close sibling relationship.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.910
Whether this is an excuse or not,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.150
at least

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.320
this treasured painting has been spared.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.440
I just wonder

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.660
if this painting will survive
for thousands of years.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.550
Who knows what will happen

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.110
thousands of years from now?

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:33.620
[The Lament of the Imperial Scandal]

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:44.440
[Benign Governance with Ease]

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.240
Your Majesty.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.980
Yin,

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.910
is today's gastrodia powder ready?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.390
I heard Your Majesty

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.840
was furious over
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal" case.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.950
This worried me

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.720
to the point of distraction,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.960
and I forgot to prepare it.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.000
This servant deserves death.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.750
This servant will go make it right away.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.390
No hurry.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.750
Do you know...

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.730
I dreamed about you last night?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.530
Your Majesty, please don't tease me.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.560
[Benign Governance with Ease]

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.870
However,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.200
it wasn't in this lifetime.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.780
No matter which lifetime,

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.270
I'm happy just to be
by Your Majesty's side.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.600
I dreamed of a thousand years from now.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.130
I was no longer the Emperor,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.390
but merely...

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.910
a clerk in a general store.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.680
A clerk?

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.250
Then what of this servant?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.320
[Benign Governance with Ease]

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.000
You were not an ordinary person

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.790
but a goddess who could

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.640
travel between heaven and earth at will.

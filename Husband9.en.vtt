WEBVTT

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:32.575
Good morning.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.201
Are you okay, Ms. Kanbe?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.585
I heard.
Hirano's turned into a stalker, huh?

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:43.502
Yeah.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.590
I will be in charge of watching over you.

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:51.552
We wouldn't want you to wander outside
and end up getting attacked by that loser.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:54.346
Did you hear from the Director?

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.682
Yeah, I had a LINE message from my brother
when I woke up

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.142
and I flew out of bed to get here.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.270
Did he say anything?

00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:06.108
Anything? You mean
besides the stalker stuff?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.281
Are you and my brother finally...

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.824
Oh, no. That's not it.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.541
Ms. Sumiyoshi, is everything all right?

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:25.586
What?

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:29.799
Yes. I can. I'll be right there.

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:30.716
What?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.884
Let's go, Miku!

00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:33.302
But...

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:38.390
Ms. Sumiyoshi.

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.894
What? You're already here?
What about work?

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.314
I took the day off for personal reasons.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.149
I'm also off on special assignment.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.109
So...

00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:52.363
Is it true that the Director came
to visit you this morning?

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.572
My brother? But why?

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:56.116
Oh, oh, no...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.201
I heard.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.994
He's your brother, right?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.121
It was quite the shock.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.708
You two asked Director Suzuki
to do that for me, right?

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:10.214 line:20%
MEDICAL REPORT

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.341 line:20%
<i>I have contacted the doctor.</i>

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.010
Here is the referral letter.

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:22.142
<i>He said he knew a great doctor and got me</i>
<i>in with a top specialist for my cancer.</i>

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:24.061
- The Director did?
- My brother did?

00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:28.774
Thanks to him, I can transfer
to another hospital for surgery.

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:29.942
Surgery?

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.320
You mean it's operable?

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.573
<i>I wish I didn't have to say this,</i>

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:40.744
but the cancer has spread
to other organs and lymph nodes.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:45.165
It would be difficult
to remove it completely with surgery.

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:52.673
So, does that mean it's too late?

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.134
The doctor really gave me a scare.

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:59.722
Said if we'd caught it even a little
later, it would've been too late.

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:05.436
Hard to believe my husband's cheating
actually helped me.

00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:09.815
Well, it may take a little time,

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.985
but I'll get the bad part cut out
and make my comeback.

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:15.362
Just wait and see.

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:19.575
That's great.

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:24.496
I'm so happy for you...

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.418
Come on, now. This is too much.

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:32.796
But... I'm sorry...

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:35.841
I'm so glad.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.554
- Well, that's great for Ms. Sumiyoshi.
- Yeah.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.932
But I'm a bit surprised.

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.768
I can't believe my brother
actually came to the hospital.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.700
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.620
- Miku.
- Huh?

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.163
Can you reach the Director?

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.374
No one can get a hold of him.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.126
My father said he hasn't
come into work either.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.633
Anyway, let's get you back somewhere safe.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:18.634
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.017
Yuto, what's going on?

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.147
Huh? My brother?

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:52.418
<i>Late last night, Mr. Suzuki contacted me.</i>

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.757
<i>I met him at my cafe this morning.</i>

00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:04.680
I'd like you to keep a close eye
on Reina Esaka's behavior from now on.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.515
Ms. Esaka?

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.643
Yes. And also...

00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:14.606
I want you to keep this for me.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.609
If anything happens to me,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.655
please use it for Ms. Kanbe.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:26.035
I promised not to open it
unless it was an emergency,

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:27.411
but I got so worried...

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.247
I thought you might be in trouble, so...

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.498
- You opened it?
- You opened it?

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.126
Yes, I opened it.

00:05:35.127 --> 00:05:36.503

possibly be thinking?

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:57.274

<i>What are you going to do after you quit?</i>

<i>You've racked up</i>
<i>quite a bit of debt, haven't you?</i>

I'd like to make amends.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.441
I will compensate you
for the emotional distress you've incurred

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.070
<i>and your situation in the company</i>
<i>will be made as favorable as possible.</i>

What are you planning to do?

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.859
Toyama is a very cold place.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.033
My great-uncle's house
would get these awful drafts,

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:48.495

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.147
Horrible!

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.232
Lie!

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:06.072
You mean about the baby?

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.784
I've got plenty of time
to pop out as many kids as I want.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:13.997
Well, if Tomoya has the money
to support them, that is.

00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:15.707
Monster!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.005
Are you referring to me?

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:30.096
Mother, the real monster isn't me, it's...

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.475
You... wicked... woman.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.937
It's... your... fault!

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.481
Shut up!

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:44.069
Stop talking like that!

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.866
Why are you being so mean?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.994
Didn't you say you
always wanted a daughter?

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:59.084
Mother, let's go shopping together again,
arm in arm, in Ginza, what do you say?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.752
Get... out!

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:06.132
Stay... away...

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:11.638
from... Tomo!

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:21.064
I knew you were only after the baby.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.581
I knew that.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:46.923
But it still... makes me sad, Mother.

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:54.681
I... am... not... your...

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.767
fucking mother!

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.405

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:46.524
KANBE FAMILY

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:55.992
It's been a long time, sir.

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.870
Thanks to you,

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:02.499
I was able to meet her. Misa is fine.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.170
She got rid of her husband and that woman,

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.548
and she has made some friends.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.260
She seems to be having
a good time at work, too.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.308
So... please don't worry.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:24.395
In your daughter's second life...

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.942
I will always be there to protect her.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.250
Thank you for coming all this way.

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:47.669
Where's Misa?

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.213
She's somewhere else. I'll drive us there.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.598
Why do I have to go on a drive with you?

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:02.308
Where's Misa?

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:03.726
Hey.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.228
Hey.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:06.855
Answer me!

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.236
Tell me...

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.865
what did Misa say about me?

00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:19.242
Please get in.

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.970
What are you planning to tell me?

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:40.305
You'll find out soon.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:44.183
Let me be clear, even if Misa apologizes,
I'll never forgive her.

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.185
Not after she betrayed me like that.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.479
Is she really the traitor here?

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:49.564
Huh?

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:53.568
She's the one who tricked me
with her constant lies.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:06.039
As long as it serves to make you happy,
the suffering of others means nothing.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.624
Have you ever felt that way?

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:09.834
You'd have to be absolute
scum to think that.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.254
Then I think you might
actually be on board.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:15.423
- Huh?
- My answer would be yes.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.801
As long as the one I love is happy,

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.096
no amount of suffering
on your part matters.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.392
If someone killed the one I love,

00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:31.064
I'd kill them without a second thought.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:34.442
Hey.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:09.686
Ms. Kanbe!

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.980
Are you okay?

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:21.739
Misa.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.121
Please get in the car. Now!

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:36.504
Drive.

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:48.808
Misa? Where are you going?

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.687
What am I going to do?

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.024
Misa!

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.687
What...

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.150
in the hell do you think you're doing?

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.907
What are you doing?

00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:52.830
If you won't answer,
I'll change my question.

00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:57.877
Director,

00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:01.547
you've died before, haven't you?

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:06.469

TOGA BRIDGE CAR ACCIDENT
RETURN TO 2015

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:26.781
You got into an accident
back there in 2025.

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:01.190
In my first life,

00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:04.944
I had every chance to do it.

00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:07.864
I'll be back after first period.

00:24:10.575 --> 00:24:12.535
Come on! That way!

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.871
<i>If I had talked to you that time...</i>

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:17.665
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:19.375
Oh, sorry.

00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.377
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.130
<i>Or that time...</i>

00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:30.678
<i>Or that time...</i>

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.806
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:38.811
<i>I could have done it any time.</i>
<i>But I never did.</i>

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:43.107
And then you died.

00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:50.865
One... more... time...

00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:03.794
If I could do it over...

00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:08.299
one more time...

00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:24.774
Why did you come to Toyama?

00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:30.988
I wanted to lay you to rest
where you felt safe.

00:25:32.823 --> 00:25:34.659
Next to your father.

00:25:43.626 --> 00:25:45.211
Are we done?

00:25:46.128 --> 00:25:48.172
I'm sure your questions
have been answered.

00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:49.757
Please go back to Tokyo.

00:25:50.633 --> 00:25:51.842
What are you saying?

00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:55.304
Ms. Sumiyoshi will be saved
if the operation is successful.

00:25:56.847 --> 00:25:57.723
But...

00:26:00.309 --> 00:26:04.313
what happens, happens,
unless there's a substitute.

00:26:07.358 --> 00:26:10.778
You would live in fear of your fate
for the rest of your life.

00:26:12.822 --> 00:26:15.700
So you tried to die with Tomoya?

00:26:17.118 --> 00:26:18.869
You were going to do it, weren't you?

00:26:19.412 --> 00:26:21.580
With Tomoya as a substitute for my death.

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:25.584
That would have set you free.

00:26:25.668 --> 00:26:27.295
Please, enough is enough!

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.338
I don't want that.

00:26:29.422 --> 00:26:33.134
If things stay like this,
your second life will end up the same.

00:26:35.011 --> 00:26:36.804
You can't beat them.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.183
You're not the kind of person
who can become a villain.

00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:47.606
So I will.

00:26:50.568 --> 00:26:52.320
Please stop with the hero act.

00:26:54.697 --> 00:26:57.742
I didn't ask for this.
I really didn't ask for this!

00:27:07.877 --> 00:27:09.420
I always thought of you.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.591
But...

00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:18.220
I couldn't play a part in your life story.

00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:21.432
I regretted it,

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:24.560
so I came back.

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.274
In your father's taxi.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.238
I came back to see you.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:54.840
Huh?

00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:56.467
Are you okay?

00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:00.179
Yes.

00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.431
Well, I'm glad I picked you up.

00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:05.142
It was fate.

00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.812
Are you in a hurry?

00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:09.230
Uh, no.

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:13.150
I know the best route,
so please leave it to me.

00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:15.361
Thank you so much.

00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:16.904
Nah, no problem at all!

00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:20.408
Sorry...

00:28:22.493 --> 00:28:24.036
Did I die?

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:30.376
This taxi can take you anywhere.

00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:32.795
Where do you want to go?

00:28:34.964 --> 00:28:35.881
Heaven?

00:28:37.341 --> 00:28:41.512
Or do you have any regrets?

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:50.688
I have... many regrets.

00:28:52.773 --> 00:28:53.774
What kind?

00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:59.071
I was slow to realize
what was important...

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:02.366
and failed to protect it.

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:08.330
In that case,
don't take the wrong path this time.

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:10.207
What?

00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:12.751
Here, hold out your hands.

00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:13.669
Huh?

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:14.753
Here.

00:29:22.636 --> 00:29:24.013
Three o'clock snacks.

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:30.561
Driver, I met you back at the university.

00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:32.855
Ms. Kanbe's...

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:38.944
Thanks for actually
coming to visit Toyama.

00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:44.533
Now it's my turn to show you the way.

00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:47.995
Now, hold on tight.

00:30:07.932 --> 00:30:08.807
Huh?

00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:23.864
Tokyo?

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:37.878

Sorry!

00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:47.865
My dream came true.

00:32:00.002 --> 00:32:05.716
In my second life... I have no regrets.

00:32:15.893 --> 00:32:17.853
You don't understand a thing.

00:32:21.732 --> 00:32:23.108
I didn't ask for this.

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:25.694
Because...

00:32:27.613 --> 00:32:29.865
in my second life...

00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:33.285
I need you.

00:32:37.247 --> 00:32:40.584
I don't want to be helped,
I don't want to be protected,

00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:44.254
I want to spend my life with you.

00:32:47.174 --> 00:32:50.219
There has to be some way
to make it work. I'm sure of it.

00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:52.930
I won't let those two destroy me.

00:32:53.847 --> 00:32:56.684
Fate's cruel and life's hard,
but we can change it!

00:32:56.767 --> 00:32:58.268
Let's believe that!

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.147
Because...

00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:05.651
that's exactly what you taught me.

00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:19.123
Remember when you were little,

00:33:20.666 --> 00:33:24.086
and you put a sweet treat in your mouth,
how easy it was to believe?

00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:29.633
That we were happy.

00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:38.559
I love you.

00:33:51.155 --> 00:33:53.407
Let's live together.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.197
So cold.

00:34:39.203 --> 00:34:41.413
Where even is this?

00:34:48.003 --> 00:34:50.714
Damn it.

00:34:52.966 --> 00:34:54.843
Anybody!

00:34:55.886 --> 00:34:58.388
Anybody here?

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.351
Answer me!

00:35:07.815 --> 00:35:09.733
Anybody?

00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:12.820
Answer me, damn it!

00:35:14.822 --> 00:35:19.868
<i>The bamboo of the kokiriko is</i>

00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:24.748
<i>Seven sun and five bu long</i>

00:35:24.832 --> 00:35:29.837
<i>Were it any longer</i>

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.424
<i>Your sleeve would catch the end</i>

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:39.847
<i>Dance at the window side, dederekoden</i>

00:35:40.514 --> 00:35:44.560
<i>Hail to the festival, dederekoden</i>

00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:51.400
<i>Dance if you fancy, dance, dance away</i>

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:56.113
<i>Leave us the little ones</i>

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.785
<i>The sasara sits</i>

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:05.455
<i>On the windowsill</i>

00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:08.500
Wrinkly school bag!

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:23.724
We're the only ones in our class
with hand-me-down school bags.

00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:29.980
But that means our bags match.
I'm so happy.

00:36:32.774 --> 00:36:37.779
My father saved the money
for my school bag,

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:40.741
but my mother spent it all.

00:36:41.575 --> 00:36:44.661
I have one, a new school bag.

00:36:44.745 --> 00:36:45.913
You do?

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:50.375
My mom and dad bought me
a shiny new school bag,

00:36:51.001 --> 00:36:54.963
but there was a poor kid in my class.
I felt sorry for them, so we traded.

00:36:55.422 --> 00:36:58.550
Wow, Reina, you're so nice.

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:06.058
That's my mom.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:12.105
Wow, Reina, your mom is so pretty!

00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:20.322
My mom is so kind.

00:37:20.948 --> 00:37:24.826
Really? I'm jealous.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.205
My dad works for a TV station in Tokyo.

00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:30.248
But I don't miss him at all.

00:37:30.832 --> 00:37:34.670
He calls me every day
and sends me lots of presents.

00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:37.673
Oh, that's nice.

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.300
Reina, that's so nice.

00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:41.677
Misa.

00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:43.553
Oh, Dad!

00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:45.263
Let's get on home.

00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:47.975
- It's already time for dinner.
- Okay. Sorry.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.269
Okay, Reina, see you tomorrow.

00:37:51.353 --> 00:37:52.270
Is that your friend?

00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:53.689
- Yeah!
- I see.

00:37:53.772 --> 00:37:55.273
What's for dinner?

00:37:55.357 --> 00:37:57.234
It's Dad's specialty, buri-daikon!

00:37:57.317 --> 00:37:58.777
Oh, yay!

00:37:59.236 --> 00:38:00.988
Better do your homework before dinner!

00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:01.905
Okay.

00:38:01.989 --> 00:38:03.448
You're a good kid, Misa.

00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:05.993
Your dad's a happy man!

00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:07.703
Here!

00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:08.912
Oh, it's a frog!

00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:45.032
I used to come here a lot
for walks with my dad.

00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:47.993
Um...

00:38:49.453 --> 00:38:51.329
It's a little hard to walk like this.

00:38:51.955 --> 00:38:53.582
I'm holding you down.

00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:56.543
So you don't fly off
and do something stupid again.

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:01.423
You also met my grandmother, didn't you?

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.759
Without saying anything to me.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.095
You're such a liar.

00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:14.394
You said you had
no more feelings for me...

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:16.772
That you'd end it.

00:39:16.855 --> 00:39:19.191
That you won't see me anymore.
Take all that back.

00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:35.373
I'm sorry that I said such
horrible things to you.

00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:41.838
So, what are your true feelings for me?

00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:46.384
Shouldn't you know that by now?

00:39:46.468 --> 00:39:48.929
I want you to put it in words.
I told you how I feel.

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.890
We're not college students
anymore, come on.

00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:52.891
What?

00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.601
Oh, is that what it is?

00:39:54.684 --> 00:39:56.895
It's because you know
I'm actually 37 years old,

00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:59.231
and you think I'm too old at 37?

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:01.108
Huh, is that what it is?

00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:18.625
I...

00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:23.296
love...

00:40:35.517 --> 00:40:36.518
Hello?

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:39.020
<i>I got your voicemail!</i>
<i>You met up with my brother, right?</i>

00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:43.275
Yeah. I have a tight grip on him now.

00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:44.734
There's no need to worry.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.320
<i>Is Reina with you?</i>

00:40:48.488 --> 00:40:49.322
Huh?

00:40:51.575 --> 00:40:54.119
It's on Reina's Instagram.

00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:55.745
Instagram?

00:41:10.969 --> 00:41:13.889 line:20%
It's been a while.
#MemoriesWithMyBestFriend #Toyama

00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:25.609
It's cold, isn't it?

00:41:26.359 --> 00:41:28.320
But you'll just have
to tough it out, okay?

00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:32.991
Your grandchild has made my heart
colder than a Toyama winter.

00:41:34.326 --> 00:41:36.286
Where are we going?

00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:40.332
Your grandchild is terrible.

00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:45.003
I've been nothing but kind to her
since she was a little girl,

00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:47.172
but she bullies me.

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:52.636
She is a self-centered, lying coward

00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:55.680
that tore my heart to shreds.

00:41:58.558 --> 00:42:00.435
And she does it all with a happy smile.

00:42:11.071 --> 00:42:16.243
That's not the kind of thing we can
just forgive people for, don't you agree?

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.837
Did you find her?

00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:28.922
No, she's not here.

00:42:29.798 --> 00:42:31.049
We'll go this way.

00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:38.306
Kikue!

00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:39.808
Grandma!

00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:42.727
- Grandma!
- Kikue!

00:42:42.811 --> 00:42:43.937
Grandma!

00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:45.647
Kikue!

00:42:46.856 --> 00:42:47.983
Kikue!

00:42:48.817 --> 00:42:50.193
Grandma!

00:42:50.277 --> 00:42:51.987
Grandma!

00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:56.074
Kikue!

00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:57.826
Grandma!

00:42:57.909 --> 00:43:00.912
- Where are you, Grandma?
- Kikue!

00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:02.580
Grandma!

00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:08.336
Please wait here.

00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:16.011
Misa!

00:43:23.852 --> 00:43:27.063
Ms. Kanbe? Ms. Kanbe!

00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:31.568
Grandma!

00:43:33.486 --> 00:43:35.155
Where are you, Grandma?

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.491
Grandma!

00:43:40.577 --> 00:43:42.078
She's gone.

00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:49.586
Misa! I finally found you!

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:51.087
Reina...

00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:55.300
Where's my grandma?

00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:57.510
What did you do to her?

00:43:57.594 --> 00:43:59.637
Why are you doing this?

00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:01.598
"Why are you doing this?"

00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:03.308
What a stupid question.

00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:05.560
Grandma has nothing to do with this!

00:44:06.895 --> 00:44:09.189
When your dad died,

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:11.524
I was so happy.

00:44:12.817 --> 00:44:16.863
I wanted to savor that same feeling
one more time.

00:44:18.198 --> 00:44:20.867
I approached you in the second grade

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.827
because you looked miserable.

00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:26.581
I thought you were just like me.

00:44:28.541 --> 00:44:30.335
But you weren't at all.

00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:34.756
You were so blessed, and still,

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.966
you acted like you were all alone.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.719
Like you were the most miserable person
in the world.

00:44:43.973 --> 00:44:46.559
I hated the way you
always played the victim...

00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:49.979
from the bottom of my heart.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.193
Where's Grandma?

00:45:15.422 --> 00:45:19.175
What part of you is all alone?!

00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:21.719
Ms. Kanbe!

00:45:22.595 --> 00:45:23.847
Ms. Kanbe!

00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:32.647
Kikue! Are you okay?

00:45:37.235 --> 00:45:39.737
- Kikue!
- Kikue!

00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:41.281
Over here!

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:42.907
Over there!

00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:53.585
How do you think I felt, listening
to all of your bitching and moaning?

00:45:54.919 --> 00:46:00.341
Your mother left you for a man?
Your father died? You have no friends?

00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:02.177
Work is hard?

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:06.055
I was much lonelier
and had it much harder than you!

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:09.976
But you were so wrapped up
in your own problems,

00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:13.938
you couldn't spare
a single thought for my feelings!

00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:33.625
If you hate me so much,
why are you so obsessed with me?

00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:35.251
Shut up!

00:46:38.713 --> 00:46:42.175
I'm trying. I'm trying all the time.

00:46:42.258 --> 00:46:45.220
I'm trying to be liked and loved.

00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:47.555
But all I ever attract is human garbage

00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:50.767
while two-faced bitches
like you get all the love,

00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:54.562
and everyone leaves me!

00:47:00.652 --> 00:47:01.945
Ms. Kanbe!

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.906
Ms. Kanbe!

00:47:12.372 --> 00:47:14.165
You lucked out.

00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:21.089
After your kind father,
you get a prince to protect you on demand.

00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:31.140
That's the way it's always been for you.

00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:01.087
Ms. Kanbe!

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:03.798
Ms. Kanbe!

00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:05.508
Ms. Kanbe.

00:48:51.763 --> 00:48:52.805
Welcome.

00:49:06.486 --> 00:49:09.656
BATTERY CHARGER

00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:29.467
STARTING

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.928
DAD - 22 MISSED CALLS
CALL - SMS

00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:39.602
Dad? Did something happen with Mom?

00:49:40.228 --> 00:49:42.522
<i>Tomoya, Mom is conscious again.</i>

00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:44.691
Oh, really?

00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:46.150
<i>But...</i>

00:49:46.776 --> 00:49:47.610
But?

00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:50.988
She fell from the bed and broke her nose.

00:49:51.698 --> 00:49:52.532
<i>What?</i>

00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:56.119
She wants to talk to you in private.

00:49:56.828 --> 00:49:59.163
I'll go change the water in the vase.

00:50:06.254 --> 00:50:07.380
<i>Mom?</i>

00:50:07.463 --> 00:50:08.631
Tomo.

00:50:09.674 --> 00:50:14.011
Thank God you're conscious.
Is your nose okay?

00:50:14.095 --> 00:50:15.513
<i>That wife of yours...</i>

00:50:16.556 --> 00:50:17.515
Huh?

00:50:17.598 --> 00:50:19.100
She hit me.

00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:21.519
Huh?

00:50:22.061 --> 00:50:25.106
<i>Your wife hit me.</i>

00:50:26.858 --> 00:50:29.110
You mean Reina hit you?

00:50:29.944 --> 00:50:30.903
Yeah.

00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:34.198
Why would she...

00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:35.491
That's absurd.

00:50:35.575 --> 00:50:38.828
<i>It's her fault.</i>

00:50:40.705 --> 00:50:42.582
Don't be fooled.

00:50:43.458 --> 00:50:47.044
Your wife... it's all her fault.

00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:52.633
That's right.

00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:57.180
If she hadn't lied about being pregnant
in the first place,

00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:59.390
I never would have gotten married.

00:50:59.474 --> 00:51:01.225
I wouldn't have lost Misa.

00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:03.186
I wouldn't have almost died in Toyama.

00:51:06.647 --> 00:51:08.316
I can't take this anymore.

00:51:10.318 --> 00:51:12.487
I don't want to live like this anymore.

00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:16.616
Tomo, poor boy.

00:51:16.699 --> 00:51:17.867
<i>Mom,</i>

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.577
I don't want this anymore.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.455
Help me!

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.665
<i>It's okay.</i>

00:51:25.625 --> 00:51:28.669
We can get it all back.

00:51:29.337 --> 00:51:30.171
What?

00:51:31.422 --> 00:51:33.341
<i>Insurance.</i>

00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:36.177
Insurance?

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.725
That woman should die.

00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:06.749
I had no idea that
you were also in Toyama.

00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:09.919
I was worried when I heard
you weren't at the hospital.

00:52:12.922 --> 00:52:16.843
You said you were going to Toyama, right?

00:52:17.802 --> 00:52:21.430
When I heard that, it made me miss
my hometown enough to go visit.

00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:28.229
I haven't told anyone about Mom.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.149
Everyone thinks she fell from her bed
and hurt herself.

00:52:32.733 --> 00:52:33.860
Don't worry.

00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:38.531
If we make a big deal out of it,
it'll just embarrass our family.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.617
Mom said something mean
to you again anyway, right?

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.874
I'm on your side, Reina.

00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.837
Listen, when things settle down,
why don't we go on a trip?

00:52:54.839 --> 00:52:56.507
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:52:57.258 --> 00:53:00.219
We didn't even go on our honeymoon.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:07.852
I put a lot of pressure on you,
like the debt and taking care of my mom.

00:53:09.228 --> 00:53:11.606
You're all I have now, Reina.

00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:15.276
I consider you my precious family.

00:53:22.074 --> 00:53:23.326
I want to start over.

00:53:25.453 --> 00:53:26.537
I love you.

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:36.964
That's the first time
you've said it like that.

00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:42.511
I'll do my best.

00:53:44.055 --> 00:53:47.725
Let's write off all
the bad things that happened.

00:53:52.313 --> 00:53:53.356
Thank you.

00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:41.612
You sure you're okay here?

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.242
I can't face your parents right now...

00:54:47.201 --> 00:54:49.412
I want one night alone
to think things over.

00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:51.330
There's nothing to think about.

00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:53.582
I'll contact you soon.

00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:55.793
Don't make me worry too much.

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:06.220
See you.

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:07.138
Yeah.

00:55:24.447 --> 00:55:26.032
"Write off"?

00:55:58.189 --> 00:55:59.315
Oh, they're back!

00:56:00.775 --> 00:56:02.276
Hey!

00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:06.322
Don't make me worry like that!

00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:07.990
Ms. Kanbe!

00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:14.080
I'm so glad that you're safe.

00:56:14.663 --> 00:56:16.791
So, Ms. Esaka hasn't been found yet?

00:56:19.043 --> 00:56:21.629
The Toyama Prefectural Police
are searching for her whereabouts.

00:56:22.338 --> 00:56:23.672
I brought it.

00:56:23.756 --> 00:56:25.674
The stuff that was delivered yesterday.

00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:28.719
Here.

00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:35.726
I ordered this from an investigation firm.

00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:37.269
Investigation firm?

00:56:46.946 --> 00:56:51.784

MOTHER, YUKA, COMMITTED SUICIDE
FATHER, YOICHI, DIED OF AN ILLNESS

That's my mom.

00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:05.131
Wow.

00:57:05.214 --> 00:57:08.217
My dad works for a TV station in Tokyo.

00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.887
What part of you is all alone?!

00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:14.265
<i>Everyone leaves me!</i>

00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:35.119
That guy tried to kill me.

00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:39.707
But Misa...

00:57:55.264 --> 00:57:56.891
She saved me.

00:58:01.312 --> 00:58:02.897
I can get it all back...

A public telephone?

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:39.016
<i>Tomoya, it's bad!</i>

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.310
Oh, Reina?

00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:43.395
<i>I just got to your mother's hospital.</i>

00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:46.357
<i>She's comatose and in critical condition.</i>

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.608
What?

00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:51.862 line:20%
<i>Are you already on the highway?</i>

00:58:51.946 --> 00:58:54.531 line:20%
Yeah. I should be there in five minutes.

00:58:54.615 --> 00:58:56.116
How's Mom doing?

00:58:56.742 --> 00:58:59.662
<i>Your mom? What are you talking about?</i>

00:59:02.164 --> 00:59:03.082
Huh?

00:59:06.502 --> 00:59:08.879
Maybe she's taking a nice, long nap.

00:59:10.547 --> 00:59:11.799
What's going on?

00:59:12.925 --> 00:59:15.427
I thought it was strange.

00:59:16.303 --> 00:59:21.141
I punched your beloved mommy in the face,
but you didn't say a word.

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:24.853
<i>And now you're saying,</i>
<i>"I'm on Reina's side"?</i>

00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:29.233
The words "write off"
also stuck with me...

00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:34.405
There's no way to write off
a 26 million yen debt, is there?

00:59:35.739 --> 00:59:38.284
No, there was.

00:59:39.618 --> 00:59:41.453
<i>I remember now.</i>

00:59:41.537 --> 00:59:42.830
<i>When we got married,</i>

00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:47.293
your mother forced me to take out
an expensive life insurance policy.

00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.004
<i>Did your mother put you up to it?</i>

00:59:50.087 --> 00:59:52.589
<i>You wanted to clear your debts, right?</i>

00:59:52.673 --> 00:59:56.385
You were going to take me on a trip
and murder me for the insurance money.

00:59:57.136 --> 00:59:59.221
Don't be ridiculous.

00:59:59.305 --> 01:00:03.934
<i>Did you search for "perfect crime" or</i>
<i>"how to murder without getting caught"?</i>

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:07.438
Nailed it, huh?!

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.899
Like you could ever pull off
the perfect crime, you idiot!

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:12.818
You're the idiot!

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.863
You hit my mom! Damn it!

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.948
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:20.326
<i>Oh, and let me apologize for this, too.</i>

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:27.708
Last night, a friend of mine
snuck into your garage.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:28.625
Huh?

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:32.463
He gave the brakes on that car
a little tweak for you.

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:33.756
Huh?!

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:42.181
<i>This counts as self-defense, right?</i>

01:00:43.015 --> 01:00:48.479
As your surviving wife, I'll be ever
so grateful for that fat death benefit.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:50.439
Screw you!

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.858
Well, enjoy your drive!

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:55.611
You bitch! I'm going to kill you!

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:24.431
Let's eat something.

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:31.188
Here. Cups?

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.106
Yeah.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:35.150
Hello?

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:37.027
<i>Misa.</i>

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:38.904
Tomoya?

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:43.367
Is Reina with you? Where are you?

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:48.122
<i>I don't know. I don't know anymore.</i>

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.875
<i>Tomoya, did something happen?</i>

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:55.295
I didn't mean to do that to you
the other day...

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:02.386
But Misa... You're the one who dumped me.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:03.470
Are you drunk?

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:04.847
<i>I was wrong.</i>

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.517
I don't know where it started,

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.687
but everything, I did everything wrong.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.861
I know,

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:22.281
I've been a failure at everything
since I was little,

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:24.533
<i>and the only one who ever praised me</i>
<i>was my mom.</i>

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:28.954
But you liked me in spite of all that.

01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:40.382
I want to start over.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.846
If I could be born again
and start my life over,

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.556
I'd like to start over with you.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.852
I won't do any more stupid shit.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.188
I won't get into debt or cheat on you.

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:58.817
And I'll be really, really
nice to you, Misa.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:05.574
Misa, I'm sorry.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:08.952
I'm sorry.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:14.208
Next time, I'll do it... I promise...

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.836
<i>I'll make you happy!</i>

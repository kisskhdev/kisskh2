WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800
{\an8}"My mother is a slave."

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.160
{\an8}"My whole family is."

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.920
{\an8}How would you say that
in French, Professor?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.280
{\an8}If you don't stop holding back, I'll have
my father get you fired from work.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.720
{\an8}PREVIOUSLY

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.000
{\an8}Let me help.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240
{\an8}I will have no choice
but to report this to the ministry

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
{\an8}and have you withdrawn
from the student list.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
{\an8}No, sir!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.920
{\an8}If I died of infection right now,
I'd die a happy man.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.320
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE-DAME

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.160
I've missed you.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.240
Please. Please get out of here, sir.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.200
This is no place for a gentleman like you.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm just a kitchen maid.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.520
I don't dare imagine myself as the mother
of a gentleman like you, sir.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.600
Mom!

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.080
How do I do this, Jam?

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.360
I've never given alms before.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.800
Let me show you.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.000
Mr. Thee.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.760
Just Thee.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920
Thee.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.680
What are you doing here?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.680
I've bought breakfast.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.760
I saw that Jam was busy preparing alms,
so I offered to bring them to you.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.320
I want to give alms too.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.720
While waiting for monks to arrive,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.280
clear your mind.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.920
You must put down whatever
is weighing on your heart.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.360
This is no time for problem-solving.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.440
All right.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.040
The monk is coming.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120
Say your prayer.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.720
Repeat after me.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.520
White as lotus is precious rice.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.600
White as lotus is precious rice.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.120
Raise them upon your head up high.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.440
Raise them upon your head up high.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.040
Send your prayer with focus.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560
Send your prayer with focus.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.040
There's a palace dessert
I want you to try.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.320
But I think you might want to try
making it yourself.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.040
What is it?

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.360
Som chun.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.800
A peculiar name,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.720
but the taste is so delightful,
it makes you forget all your worries.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.920
- Really?
- Yes, sir!

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.320
Boil jasmine-infused water with sugar.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.720
Add pandan and bitter orange juice
for fragrance.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.760
Boil to make syrup.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.200
Let it simmer.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.480
Pick any fruits you like.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.160
Add the syrup.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.400
Now, freeze overnight.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.520
Thee.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.880
Here.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.840
Spoon, sir.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.480
How is it, sir?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.800
Scrumptious.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.600
It's so refreshing and delightful.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.560
If my heart were a person,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.160
it would be dancing unstoppably.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.400
How so, sir?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.240
Like this.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.240
Jam. Kui. Mhay.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.720
Try it.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.360
I want to see if it makes you dance
like your master says.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.520
Gladly, sir!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.000
Are you sure, my lord?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.120
Kui, grab that.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.200
You should try it too.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.960
Let him try another bite, Mr. Rati.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.520
Jam.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.640
Make it a big bite, sir.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.600
I wonder how fast your heart
is dancing now, my lord.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.960
Aren't you chatty today, Jam?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.600
It puts my mind at ease to see you smile.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.320
Last night,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.640
I dreamed of my mother, Buaphan.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.560
Even in my dreams,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.880
she doesn't accept me as her son.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.800
I don't understand

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.000
why she disowned me.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.880
It hurt you so much that
it haunted your dreams.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.440
Imagine how your mother feels.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.840
I believe she said what she did
out of love, not indifference.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.920
Love?

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.000
Put yourself in Buaphan's shoes.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.880
She is a kitchen maid
in Lord Ruj's Suriyakorn Palace.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.440
If she were to openly love you as her son,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.680
how would that make Lord Ruj feel?

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.880
He would probably grow
even more tempestuous

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.360
and take it out on my mother.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.600
And on you, Rati.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.400
She did what she did to protect me?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.080
The bond between a mother and a son
is not so easy to sever.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.520
I believe time will bring relief
to you and your mother someday.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.720
And I will make sure
that day comes very soon.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.600
You really are good to me, Thee.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.960
When I go back to France,
I will miss you dearly.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.960
Will you miss me at all?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.120
I don't have to wait to find out.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.120
I miss you
as soon as you're out of my sight.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.120
I am out of your sight now.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.400
Do you miss me?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.200
What's the matter?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.720
It's nothing.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.760
I swear I took a shower.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.040
It's not that.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.680
Why did you sniff me, then?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.080
I caught a whiff
of something nice from you.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.400
It smells sweet and tender,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.480
and sort of cool.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.520
I see.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.400
That would be bunga rumpai,
a flower sachet used to perfume clothes.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.600
Do you like it?

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.640
I do. The scent makes me happy.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.560
Well, then…

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.320
Does it smell stronger up close?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.560
"Bonjour."

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.400
"Bonsoir."

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.320
"Bonne nuit."

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.320
Bonjour.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.080
Bonjour.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.440
Bonsoir.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.600
Bonne nuit.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.240
Aren't you fluent,

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.680
Monsieur Mek?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
Would you like to borrow it?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.520
But first, you have to tell me

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.000
why you want to learn the language.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.600
I never got to go to school.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.760
Listening in on classes is all I can do.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.280
As for why I want to learn it…

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.600
Even I don't know that.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.040
I just want to be smarter.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.000
I think knowing
is better than not knowing.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.800
Maybe one day I can be a translator
and work for the government.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.440
What?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.520
You don't believe someone like me
deserves a good job?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.960
I haven't said a thing.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.320
I will lend it to you.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.920
But…

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.960
You're a gentleman.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.080
Why do you want to learn muay?

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.680
Not unlike you, Monsieur Mek,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.000
I also think knowing
is better than not knowing.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.240
Who knows when this might come in handy?

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.000
Better yet,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.360
at the upcoming Lent Day festival,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.040
I might even defeat you, Monsieur Mek.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.520
I'm ready.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.800
If you want me to teach you French,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.360
you must teach me muay, Monsieur Mek.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.480
Of course, sir.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.720
I will make sure my lessons
match your kindness.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.160
Lesson one.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.120
The pomelo stalk step.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200
Ow!

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.520
Ow!

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.600
Lesson two.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.440
Banana tree steel legs.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.760
- Do it, sir.
- Do it, sir.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.760
All right!

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.520
Next lesson.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.240
Log pulling for strength building.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320
- Hurry up!
- Faster!

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.520
Faster, faster, faster!

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.680
- Hurry up!
- Faster!

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.880
Faster! Faster!

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.320
- Faster!
- Ugh!

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.600
I won't put up with this!

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200
Hey.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.280
That was barely training.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.160
Don't be a baby, sir.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.080
Did you just call me a "baby"?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.560
Hold on.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.600
Lie down.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.640
Lie flat on your back, sir.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.960
Breathe out.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.040
Careful!

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.480
Breathe slowly, sir.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.680
I'll stretch your leg.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.360
Now the other leg.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.480
Breathe out.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.720
This is going to hurt.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800
Mek!

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.200
It will feel better soon, sir.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.120
You must work on your core strength, sir.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.480
When your midriff is strong,

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.600
you won't get hurt so easily.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.480
Does it feel better now?

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.359
Yeah. It does.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.000
Careful.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.280
That was clearly a prank on me.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.720
What good would that do me, sir?

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.160
You were kind enough not to get me
in trouble for hitting you,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.040
and now you're going to teach me French.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.280
You are a literal angel to me, sir.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.760
You're trying to flatter me
with that praise!

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.240
You love to be praised, don't you?

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.240
Mek, watch it!

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.080
I see you feel better!

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.360
Let's get back to training.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.240
Ko. Dang. Help me out!

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.880
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.680
- Get up, sir.
- Let's go.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.560
Hang on! I don't want to!

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.520
No!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.520
No!

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.600
I'm all bruised just on my first day.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.400
How does he do it every day?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.600
Breathe out.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.000
This is going to hurt.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.960
It will feel better soon, sir.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.120
I think knowing
is better than not knowing.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.920
Maybe one day I can be a translator
and work for the government.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.800
…now you're going to teach me French.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.600
You are a literal angel to me, sir.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.920
A literal angel…

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.240
Why do you want to
take a bath in the river?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.840
I've never done it before,
and it looks like fun.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.520
It seems you only want to play.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.400
Would you like to take a bath too?

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.920
I've already taken a shower at home.
Have fun.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.560
Be careful.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.400
Kui.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.600
Take care of your master!

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.280
- Hey!
- Let's go!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.800
Kui!

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.560
Ugh! Kui!

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.760
How can you go ahead before your master?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.120
I'm only making sure
Mr. Rati will be safe!

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.640
Get in the water, Mr. Rati!

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.480
Please, don't jump in. It's dangerous.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.000
You're not used to the water.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.600
All right.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.680
- Do you need my help with that?
- No. I got it.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.760
It's not too late
to change your mind, Thee.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.000
I will wait for you here.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.760
Go on, Mhay.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.680
Take care of him.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.120
Are you sure, my lord?

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.760
Get in!

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.680
Oh, Mhay.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.120
I'm going in, Kui.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.600
Watch me, Mr. Rati.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200
Get out of my way, Kui!

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.760
Careful, sir.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.280
Hold on to these, Mr. Rati.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.080
Would you like to try jumping in, sir?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160
From here?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.400
No, sir.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.440
From up there.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.920
Thee would never allow it.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.120
I believe he will understand, sir.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.560
He will!

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.680
Trust me, sir. You should try asking him.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.880
All right. Let's go!

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.960
You can do it, sir.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.520
- Go for it!
- Kui, hold these.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.920
- Go for it, sir.
- Go for it.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.880
- You can do it, sir.
- Go, go, go!

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.680
Mhay, go and wait for him.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.040
Take care of him, you two!

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.080
Thee.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.560
I want to try jumping into the river.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.960
You shouldn't.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.600
You don't know how to jump. It will hurt.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.000
But if you don't let me,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.520
how will I learn how the locals live?

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.160
I just want to try it once or twice.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.160
I won't bring it up ever again.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.280
I promise.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.960
All right.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.560
If you believe you can do it,
I'll agree to it.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.000
Guys, Thee agreed!

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.360
Jump right in, sir!

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.480
Kui. Mhay. Move aside!

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.080
Let me show you how the French do it.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.880
Let's go, Kui! Come on.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.160
One.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.000
Two.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.200
Ah--

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.720
Rati!

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.160
Bonjour!

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.760
Oh, Mr. Rati!

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.720
Don't get out of the water just yet, sir.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.160
I'll fetch you your loincloth.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.280
Thanks, Jam.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.560
Stay still.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.600
Well?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.680
See what happens
when you don't listen to me?

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.280
I don't want to hear your lecture.
I'm going inside.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.240
You saw Kui and Mhay.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.440
Did you not notice they hiked up
their loincloths to their thighs?

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.760
Doing that prevents this from happening.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.240
I'm afraid I can't face anyone now.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.000
You can face me.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.200
I guess you've had enough
of playing in the river?

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.880
Are you trying to embarrass me, Thee?

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.320
I don't care what you say.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.680
I live just an arm's length away.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.200
I can play again whenever I like.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.800
Are you still being stubborn?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.920
Do not come here alone.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.600
Do not come here with anyone.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.160
If I don't tell you, you'll never know.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.800
You would ignore my good intentions
after seeing how much I worry about you?

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.560
Next time,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.800
do not be so careless.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.720
Do you realize

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.440
how much I care for you?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.440
Mhay.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.120
Can we trust your master?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.880
What are you suggesting?

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.000
Is it true that your master
is "that way" inclined?

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.640
Jam, don't you dare accuse my lord!

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.520
I am only repeating what I heard.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.320
Mr. Rati is naïve and kind.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.320
He doesn't deserve to have
his name smeared.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.400
I agree.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.640
You love your master.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.400
We love ours.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.560
The rumor came from the ladies
my master has turned down.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.160
He is engaged, and to the daughter
of a minister, no less.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.120
Keep that in mind.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.320
- Really?
- Really?

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.640
The daughter of a minister?

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.040
Just wait until Lent Day and you'll see.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.160
Do you realize

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.840
how much I care for you?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.680
Mr. Rati?

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.400
Goodness.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.880
You scared me for a second.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.520
What are you doing alone here in the dark?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.120
I came here to think.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.800
Don't worry about me, Jam.
Just go to bed.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.840
Is something troubling you, sir?

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.760
It's not exactly troubling me.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.520
I don't quite understand myself
what it is.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.880
Do you want me to help you, sir?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.320
I've been through a lot.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.360
I am more experienced than I look, sir.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.200
I feel strange around Thee.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.560
When he got close to me today,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.520
my heart…

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.760
wasn't exactly nervous or startled.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.960
But it felt strange.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440
How so, sir?

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.560
I suddenly felt like I was burning inside
despite being in the water.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.920
I felt hollow despite not being dizzy.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.400
I felt…

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.720
like if I did not hold on to something,

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.720
I might have floated away.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.680
I don't quite know what it means.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.080
Do you, Jam?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.000
Do you know what it is?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.080
I doubt it means anything at all, sir.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.520
You must be overthinking.
Take a good night's rest.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.400
Don't let your mind dwell on it.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.360
Anyway, he is engaged.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.400
He is engaged?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.680
I… am going to bed, sir.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.480
Look, Dech.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.120
This is Duke Kadissorn,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.360
This is Dech,

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.560
Mom Luang Dechapatrapee.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.680
My only son.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.160
He's highly interested in Foreign Affairs,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.240
though he had the strange idea of wanting
to start at the Customs Department.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.320
He claimed it would greatly help him
get familiar with foreigners,

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.680
which would be helpful for him with his
work in Foreign Affairs in the future.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.240
I do hope to gain your patronage, my lord.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.120
Dech, isn't it?

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.440
Why do you want to work
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.560
Ow! My stomach hurts.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.680
- What's wrong?
- Take it, Father.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.560
Excuse me, my lord.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.120
Hey.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.840
Baronet?

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.360
Baronet!

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.560
Dech!

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.760
Dech.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.840
Hey! Get out of my way!

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.520
Apologies, sir.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.400
Dech.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.600
That good-for-nothing son of mine.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.320
To think I'd see a baronet like you
hiding like a thief.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.880
Did my father leave?

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.440
He did, sir.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.200
Go.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.920
Go find food, Little Mek.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.240
Where are you going?

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.640
Lotus buds are beautiful as they are.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.120
Why must we fold their petals?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.040
We need lotuses that are in full bloom
for offerings.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.800
It symbolizes the determination
to be in full bloom,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.080
which means to be aware and enlightened.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.160
You're not busy today, Thee?

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.600
No. It's Lent Day.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.360
Any good Buddhist
must visit a temple today.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.800
I will go to work afterwards.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.800
Don't you have to go with your…

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.120
Your fiancée?

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.920
It is such an important day.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.240
I believe you should spend it
with your fiancée.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.800
I don't know where you heard that,
or even what you heard.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.360
- But the truth is--
- Master.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.840
Master.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.640
Master.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.240
Her Highness, your grandma,
wants to see you, sir.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.640
She insists you must
return home immediately.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.200
I'm afraid I have to go.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.800
Meanwhile,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.160
I ask that you don't jump
to any conclusions.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.960
We will offer water lilies
together tonight.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.120
I will explain everything then.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.840
Wait for me.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.640
Why did he invite me?

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.040
I wonder, sir.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.240
Only couples go there.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.640
How can you go with him, sir?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.520
You are not going to go offer water lilies
with him, are you, Mr. Rati?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.080
You're taking your time, sir.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.520
I am here to pick Rati up.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.360
He is not here.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.560
Where is he?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.560
Jam.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.320
Did you not hear me?

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.520
- I did, sir.
- Why didn't you answer me?

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.440
My lord,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.920
I respect you

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.080
and I love Mr. Rati.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:29.000
Are you sure about this offering?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.760
I don't want you and Mr. Rati
to be in a difficult situation.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.080
Please reconsider, sir.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.960
Jam.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.560
If I were to tell you
I have thoroughly considered it,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.160
what would you say?

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.520
Will you tell me now where Rati is?

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.480
Pardon me, Monsieur Rati.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.640
Thee?

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.360
Rati.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.560
Can you please tell him that
I am your guardian,

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.640
not a trespasser.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.800
What were you thinking,
barging into a legation after dark?

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.080
I wasn't.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.320
I was only thinking of you.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.800
It completely slipped my mind
that this place was a legation.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.040
To think a noble would be mistaken
for a simple thief.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.920
Are you working?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.840
Yes.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.720
I still have a lot of documents
to translate.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.320
Then… I'll wait.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.080
Please, don't.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.640
I want you to come with me
to offer some water lilies.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.760
Just focus on your work.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.960
Don't worry about me. I can wait.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.280
I love waiting.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.360
You must stay where I can see you.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.120
Are you worried about me?

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.920
I fear the guards might come
and arrest you again.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.560
Oh, Rati…

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.880
I will resume my work now.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.080
Thee.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.520
What time is it, I wonder?

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.560
What are you doing walking around?

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.320
You saw?

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.920
You paced the entire room.
It would be a wonder if I didn't.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.320
It was nothing.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.320
I've just

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.200
never seen you when you're working.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.600
When you're working,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.520
you look so serious.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.400
You seem so mature.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.840
I can say the same thing about you.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.880
When you're not working,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.200
you're so fidgety, like a child.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.040
I'm getting back to work.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.200
Thee!

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.440
Don't distract someone who is working,

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.520
Little Theerathon.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.440
I am not a child.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.600
Sir. Madam.
Would you like some water lilies?

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.200
Two flowers for a quarter.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.920
Here, ma'am.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.120
Thank you.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.560
I can't sell this because it's broken.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.720
I'll give it to you, sir.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.440
Stingy.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.720
That will be half a quarter.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.040
Not funny.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.040
I was only joking, sir.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.680
We're friends. Stop calling me "sir."

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.040
Are you sure?

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.720
Can I call you
"Young Master Dech" instead?

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.360
I heard your attendants call you that.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.440
"Young Master" is such an adorable title.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.560
It suits you, sir.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.240
Young Master Dech.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.920
It doesn't sound like
we are friends at all.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.680
Friends don't care for titles.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.120
Would you prefer just your name?

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.560
Yes.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.200
Call me simply by my name,
just as I call you by yours.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.400
Dech.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.720
Mek.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.000
If you insist,

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.680
Dech.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.120
Let's go, Dech.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.600
Hold on.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.800
Where are we going?

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.040
We're going to offer the water lilies
to the Mai Maan Shrine.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.640
It's all right that you're here
without a significant other.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.680
Just think you're praying that you
and your father finally get along.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.280
Or would you rather pray for romance?

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.320
There are only lotuses,
and no water lilies.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.640
I believe they've all been picked.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.800
We'll try over there.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.360
You shouldn't have waited for me.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.680
Your fiancée must be fuming
with impatience right now.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.960
I am not engaged.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.640
But there is a lady my grandmother
wants me to get to know.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.560
If it were up to me,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.840
I would rather not be pursuing
a relationship with anyone.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.920
Why not?

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.360
I am waiting for someone.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.800
Jam told me only couples
offer water lilies to the Mai Maan Shrine.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.200
So why…?

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.040
Yes.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.760
Why indeed?

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.160
Water lilies.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.120
Those really are water lilies.
And there are two of them.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.680
I have been blessed.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.200
People are mostly gone.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.840
What's the matter?

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:41.600
Thee.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.920
I think this is where you should
bring your fiancée,

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.920
not me.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.800
Why not you?

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.400
Because I am…

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.680
A man?

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.760
I've never wanted to give alms
with anyone but you, Rati.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.840
If anyone were to see us…

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.080
If anyone were to see us,

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.480
they might think
I was trying to seduce you.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.320
Are you afraid of being lumped together
with someone "that way" inclined like me?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.760
Thee.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.320
I would never think that.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.200
I'm sorry.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.120
Are you disgusted by me?

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.320
I would never be.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.080
I know you're not the kind of person
they say you are.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.720
They're just talking nonsense.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.800
I know you don't care about what they say.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.360
And if I really am what they say I am?

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.400
If the only reason I don't care

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.840
is because it is all true…

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.400
will the rumor still mean nothing to you?

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.760
I do not desire women.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.360
I do not care for men.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.200
I never had such notions in my head.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.200
But if one day

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.000
I were to meet someone
whom my heart desired,

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.920
and that person happened to be a man,

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.040
not a woman…

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.160
would you still say…

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.920
you were not disgusted by me?

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.320
Whoever it is you desire,

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.920
I promise to like them.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.280
The person who can captivate your heart

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.280
must be someone special, man or woman.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.960
If people still talk badly about you,

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.520
I promise to defend your honor.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.800
My lord?

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.520
Is that you, my lord?

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.600
- Lord Ruj?
- Go!

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.800
Leave me be! Go and check them out!

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.760
- Yes, sir!
- Hurry!

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.120
Where is he?

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.080
Where has he gone?

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.960
You are all useless!

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.920
- Father?
- How could you miss them?

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.440
Over there!

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.560
Who's there?

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.520
After them! Go!

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.560
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.320
I guess it is no mere rumor what they say
about your sexuality, is it, my lord?

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.680
Dech?

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.760
Father.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.320
What?

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.360
Who are you?

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.440
Uh…

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.880
The baronet hired me
as his rickshaw-puller.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.360
His lover is very beautiful, sir.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.320
They are perfect for each other.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.440
Sir, do you want to go home now?

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.640
If not, I must charge you
extra for overtime.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.720
I will go home, then.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.000
I'll see you back at the palace, Father.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.560
What?

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.760
What's with him?

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.520
Where's the count?

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.520
I believe they're gone.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.680
What was Lord Ruj doing here?

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.760
Do you think he saw you?

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.440
It's all right.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.600
I don't want your reputation ruined.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.920
You're worried about me?

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.520
Of course.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.040
How much do you worry about me?

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.920
"The person who can captivate your heart
must be someone special, man or woman."

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.080
"Whoever it is you desire,

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.640
I promise to like them."

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.760
Is that so?

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.840
{\an8}You cannot go to the festival
with anyone but me tonight.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.440
{\an8}It is my sole responsibility
to take you to the festival.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.760
{\an8}I do want to float a lantern
like everyone else.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:01.680
{\an8}Can you come?

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.880
{\an8}My father insisted I must bring some lady
to the festival tonight.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.000
{\an8}Thee.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.440
{\an8}This is Mom Rajawong Tikumporn Borrirak,
the daughter of Duke Udomsawaddamrong.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.960
{\an8}Thee made this krathong from scratch.
How could he not come?

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.040
{\an8}Right?

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.600

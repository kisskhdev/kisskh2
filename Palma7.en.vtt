Can I practice putting on a garter?

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.933

Well, it's only been a few months.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.566
We are about to graduate.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.566
of course

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.733
When we go to college, we will take different paths.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.533

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.733

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.666
I think Jake and I had lunch together twice.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.666
of course

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:50.100
The girls are shocked again.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.966
nothing at all

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:52.766
container

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:53.966
their envy

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.466
We also became the subject of gossip.

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:18.366
because at school

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:19.466
of course

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.766
We are often together.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:33.933
We are okay until Christmas.

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:35.700

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:40.900

given gift

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.066
but even if it rains

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.366
He still rushed to recover.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:49.966
thank you

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:53.166
said

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.800
I also told him that we would be going on vacation for Christmas.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.466
break so we can't meet for now

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:00.666
He just said okay.

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:15.333

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.800

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:19.733
that's it

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:20.866

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:22.666

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.566

I don't think I can stop them anymore.

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.933
I guess there's nothing I can do.

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:10.400

You're still getting better for Drake, right?

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:16.366
She is getting more beautiful.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.533
Oh, I don't know about you.

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:20.000
Who told you to wait for me here?

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:21.100
I don't know about you either.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.100
I said so.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.800
I don't know anyone there.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:26.200
Why am I going alone?

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:29.266

The woman will also be crushed and given up.

00:13:30.766 --> 00:13:31.666

00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:33.866

How are you saying that?

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:36.966
This seems crazy.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:37.800

00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:59.100
I just need it for closure.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.800
I love you.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:04.866

about myself

00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:10.766
I like it when I tell you that I love you.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.366
I'm so sure.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:14.266

00:17:20.766 --> 00:17:21.566

Are you Drake?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.700
You know I don't know anyone here.

00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:26.566
He still left me.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.500

00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:45.533

00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:19.866
She is your girlfriend.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.300

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.766
Your father and I are married.

00:20:32.366 --> 00:20:34.133
What don't you understand?

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.600
i'm blinded by you

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:39.733

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.400
hell no

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.300
because

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.800
you keep on entertaining me

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.366
i know you want me to

00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:54.666
You know the truth.

00:20:55.366 --> 00:20:55.866
concern

00:20:55.866 --> 00:20:57.666
I'm just with you because I know how much you still love me.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.266
beautiful

00:20:58.266 --> 00:20:59.200
for the loss of your mommy

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.066
your witch

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.733
maybe

00:21:03.733 --> 00:21:04.533
but for now

00:21:04.566 --> 00:21:05.900
I'm your stepmom.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:07.866
and now Ali is here

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:08.933
in your life

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:11.133
choose her

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.900
Don't play with his feelings.

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:18.066
That's right, Drake.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.366
i'm sorry mom

00:21:34.066 --> 00:21:35.333
i could not stop that

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:36.666
from marrying her

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:39.700
but i'll still try

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.600
for you

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.666
Why is that, Jake?

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:18.733
Why are you playing with my feelings?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.300

00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:28.133
crying

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.466
I'm not just crying.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.100
mommy

00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:36.933

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:38.800

at daddy

00:23:40.133 --> 00:23:42.100
Only Cyril can make you cry.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.066
to me like this

00:23:46.366 --> 00:23:48.000
Why are you crying?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.533
jake sebastian palma

00:24:22.266 --> 00:24:23.066
five

00:24:24.133 --> 00:24:25.066
your problem

00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.000
Kiss me, my child.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.066
alice is here

00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:30.066
She is your girlfriend.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.400
i know but i want you

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.200
I don't know why I'm like this.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.666
when I was still a child

00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:36.866
Can't sleep?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.900
It's always when I close my eyes.

00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.900
I can hear Drake and Tita talking.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.766
katrina

00:24:41.766 --> 00:24:42.800
I have no right.

00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:43.766
It hurts, huh?

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:44.333
girlfriend

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:45.133
just me

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:46.366
I don't love you.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.800
today

00:24:50.933 --> 00:24:52.300
Do you have a fever?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.100
Why are you studying?

00:24:58.966 --> 00:24:59.800
oh my

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.700
concerned

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.933
concerned about

00:25:03.566 --> 00:25:04.900
What happened to you?

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.066
I don't know

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.800
Maybe this is really the case, right?

00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:09.766
you are moving

00:25:09.866 --> 00:25:11.100
your attention to others

00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:14.266
so you don't have to think about the things that hurt you

00:25:14.766 --> 00:25:15.566
why?

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.966
Nothing, I'm just bored lol

00:25:19.266 --> 00:25:20.666
Studying because I'm bored.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.200
you know

00:25:22.366 --> 00:25:23.566
Let's just have lunch.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.900
Just eat it.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.166
Fight your boredom.

00:25:27.466 --> 00:25:28.400
I don't want to go out.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.066
I am not ready to see yet.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.000
you are strong

00:25:31.066 --> 00:25:32.466
I'm hurt, come on.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.266
I have a gift, go first.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.400
wow

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.133
Really, where do you think?

00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.100
from Singapore

00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:43.133
given by daddy

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.200
This is where Aunt Liana is based now.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.666
your stepmom

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:52.733
That's terrible.

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:55.133
many more imported

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.600
Don't share anymore.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.500
The stinginess is severe.

00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:01.900
Uncle Sai and I are close, huh?

00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:07.400
share your blessings

00:26:09.066 --> 00:26:09.900
I don't want to

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.900
stingy

00:26:14.766 --> 00:26:16.366
I'll just eat alone at the café.

00:26:24.733 --> 00:26:25.533
luh

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.700
Oh, he's really stingy.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.366
Take care of that.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.400
to you

00:26:46.766 --> 00:26:48.333
I won't give it to you.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.333
This is all mine.

00:26:54.733 --> 00:26:55.533
lunch

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.700
I'm still full.

00:27:00.366 --> 00:27:01.600
This is difficult.

00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:03.800
I can't ignore him.

00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:05.133
I don't like him either.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.166
can be sung

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.733
because it's not his fault

00:27:07.766 --> 00:27:09.133
that I like him/her

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.366
Oh, how bleak life is!

00:27:12.866 --> 00:27:14.100
Can't I like him?

00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:14.866
he likes me

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:15.666
end of story

00:27:15.966 --> 00:27:16.766
lunch

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.933
I said I'm still full.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.266
It smells like poison.

00:27:59.266 --> 00:28:00.066
and good

00:28:00.966 --> 00:28:02.300
This is really crazy.

00:28:17.366 --> 00:28:18.166
hmm

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.666
i really love this ramen

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:21.866
wow

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.100
This is the ramen.

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:24.066
beloved

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.933
shut up and eat

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:43.566
still full

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.800
Will you kill me?

00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:53.133
no or no

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.000
why would i do that to my girlfriend

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.400
girlfriend

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.566
but it hurts

00:29:08.566 --> 00:29:09.800
about that drake

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.933
Let's break up.

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:18.866
why is that

00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:20.666
why is it like

00:29:20.666 --> 00:29:21.733
The treatment is different.

00:29:21.866 --> 00:29:22.700
him to me now

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.900
I prefer the old days when he didn't look at me.

00:29:26.466 --> 00:29:28.000
that he ignored me

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.000
that he doesn't talk to me

00:29:30.733 --> 00:29:31.933
This is difficult.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.700
good

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.466
I said can we break up?

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.500
why

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.766
Well, because you don't like me.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.766
I don't like you either.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600
i don't want to

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:51.066
Let's take a break.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.933
Go ahead, please.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.300
your reason is not enough

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.333
Miss Perez

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.533
Well, I don't want to.

00:29:57.766 --> 00:29:58.766
i want out

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.400
you're the one

00:30:05.466 --> 00:30:06.100
volunteered

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:06.900
to be my girlfriend

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.733
i really bought that for you

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.133
Don't touch me.

00:30:44.266 --> 00:30:45.533
torture drake

00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:00.166
good

00:31:00.266 --> 00:31:01.066
the pepper

00:31:01.166 --> 00:31:01.966
here too

00:31:12.866 --> 00:31:14.166
We're lonely here, huh?

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.100
shin

00:31:17.966 --> 00:31:19.100
Why are you here?

00:31:19.766 --> 00:31:21.600
nothing but something else

00:31:21.933 --> 00:31:23.700
Why aren't you with Kent?

00:31:24.066 --> 00:31:24.900
at the cafe

00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:26.266
with aya

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.000
That's a strong hit on your best friend.

00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:29.766
They're so cute, aren't they?

00:31:29.866 --> 00:31:30.666
they are good

00:31:35.766 --> 00:31:36.566
shin

00:31:36.966 --> 00:31:37.866
Are you okay?

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.666
We're really breaking up, Alice.

00:31:43.866 --> 00:31:44.700
what exactly

00:31:45.366 --> 00:31:47.100
Well, haven't you guys been on a break for a long time?

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.766
This is final.

00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:52.733
because the real break

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.266
back to back

00:32:00.166 --> 00:32:00.966
it's fine

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.366
at least now

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.266
I can really move on now.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.266
okay lang yan shin

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:13.400
You'll know when you're in college at Saint Colette.

00:32:13.533 --> 00:32:14.166
academy

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:16.533
You can find something better than that, right?

00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:18.966
I don't know.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.800
come what may

00:32:21.733 --> 00:32:24.100
As long as I enjoy being single for now

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.333
Isn't that best friend?

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.100
Let's eat.

00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:30.400
That's for me.

00:32:32.766 --> 00:32:33.800
ah jake

00:32:43.366 --> 00:32:45.066

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:45.966
what the hell

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.100
what is that

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:49.133
today

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.766
What's your problem? Why did you do that?

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.566
Oh, let me go, Jake.

00:32:58.766 --> 00:32:59.766
let me go

00:33:01.533 --> 00:33:02.300
next time

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.700
when I give you something

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.866
Don't give it to others.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.066
Why are you shouting?

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.366
because you're forcing me to

00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:13.466
Don't you know that sharing is caring?

00:33:14.466 --> 00:33:15.266
it's useless

00:33:16.733 --> 00:33:18.500
i forgot that you're in love with him

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.133
yes, no

00:33:24.366 --> 00:33:26.800
would you do me a favor and break up with me

00:33:28.766 --> 00:33:30.600
because he and Kaye have broken up

00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:34.566
maybe i stand

00:33:34.766 --> 00:33:35.800
you don't stand a chance

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:38.800
not when i'm around

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.800
the same

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.600
together with you

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.100
the same

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.900
together with you

00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:50.333
Why don't you want to let me go?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.100
aunt

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:52.800
katrina

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.600
You like it, don't you?

00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:00.800
I know, Jake.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.800
I know you're just playing with me.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.200
so please

00:34:07.133 --> 00:34:08.600
Let's finish this.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.500
You're being unfair, Jake.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.200
what if

00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:18.066
I already like you.

00:34:18.133 --> 00:34:19.133
That's it.

00:34:20.566 --> 00:34:22.933
I'm poor because you don't love me.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.766
i can't promise to catch you when you fall

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.533
but i assure you

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.366
that i'll be here

00:34:44.733 --> 00:34:45.766
while you're falling

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.866
Should I be thrilled?

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.900
cause i don't make promises that i can't keep

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.466
but i promise

00:35:14.733 --> 00:35:15.966
that i'll try to fall

00:35:16.333 --> 00:35:17.300
while you're falling

00:35:19.933 --> 00:35:21.333
What if you didn't fall?

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.200
I'm not crying anymore.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.666
Why is that?

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.200
even if he says so

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.566
that he will divide my heart into five

00:35:32.733 --> 00:35:33.466
will be thrilled

00:35:33.466 --> 00:35:34.266
I am still here.

00:35:38.466 --> 00:35:39.266
come along

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.133
i'm not a prince

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.600
i'm not

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.400
charming

00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:46.533
i can cause pain

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.400
without

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.200
realizing it

00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:49.366
gone

00:35:49.866 --> 00:35:51.466
You lost again, Alice.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.666
but you will also try to help me

00:35:53.866 --> 00:35:54.933

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.733
try me

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:02.666
not to hurt

00:36:07.066 --> 00:36:09.133
and we won't regret it

00:36:10.933 --> 00:36:11.733
so

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.000
Can I say this?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.200
i like you so much

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.133

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.733
to try and make you fall for me

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.100
still you

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.333
Let's get dressed later.

00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:54.133
You want us to be together?

00:36:54.533 --> 00:36:55.333
movie house

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.800

Okay, okay, honey.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.933
Do you know how many months I have?

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.000
flirting with you

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.166
Don't you intend to answer me?

00:37:07.466 --> 00:37:09.133
Well, you never stopped flirting.

00:37:09.466 --> 00:37:10.133
Hello there.

00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:11.066
You know that.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.666
I love you so much that I can't bear it.

00:37:12.766 --> 00:37:13.566

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.000
Well, don't wait for nothing.

00:37:19.733 --> 00:37:20.533

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.133
I will count on you.

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:49.966
That witch hurt me.

00:37:51.933 --> 00:37:52.966

00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:54.933

00:37:55.133 --> 00:37:56.300
Hey, are you okay?

00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.000
Brother Bernadette

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.700
Can I be your girlfriend?

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.666

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.466

look at it kl

00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:09.166
This is the thickness of the face.

00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:10.400
to flirt and say

00:38:10.466 --> 00:38:12.066
I love you and then suddenly give up.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.700
You are shameless.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.600

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.900

00:38:15.966 --> 00:38:17.133
You're just fooling me.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.500
When did you answer me?

00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:19.466
just now

00:38:19.666 --> 00:38:20.566

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.500

00:38:26.266 --> 00:38:27.366
let's break

00:38:27.866 --> 00:38:29.666
Hey, you love me.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.600
yes indeed

00:38:31.166 --> 00:38:32.900
It's hard to have a playboy.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.166
That boyfriend?

00:38:34.366 --> 00:38:35.166
oh my god

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.700

00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:39.600
not

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.066
Why are you abandoning me?

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.466
Just wait, honey.

00:38:44.766 --> 00:38:45.600

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.600

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.566
Shin is crying.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.533
Oh, so you have a diary?

00:38:53.266 --> 00:38:54.066
the weirdo

00:38:54.133 --> 00:38:55.133
your two friends

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:56.800
The woman spoke.

00:38:56.866 --> 00:38:57.733

00:38:57.866 --> 00:38:58.300

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.300
Why do you have a diary?

00:39:00.733 --> 00:39:01.200
of course

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.133
so that I don't forget

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.866

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.200

00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:16.300

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.733
Okay, I'll go.

I will join you.

00:40:18.966 --> 00:40:20.666
Let's not go to first class.

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:25.133
You're still too lazy to study, aren't you?

00:40:25.366 --> 00:40:26.866

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.933
Why are you only eating now?

00:40:33.266 --> 00:40:34.466
drake is rude

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.300
Why did you do what?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.266
You threw away my food.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.700
really

00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:41.400
Jealousy, I guess.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.100
I am with

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.000

that you're in love with me

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.333

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.550
Dad,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.580
please explain everything to me.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.120
You are Prince Khanin,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.570
the only heir of the Assavadevathin clan.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.450
Your mother was ambushed.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.910
She did not survive the incident.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.990
His Majesty sent me in secret
to rescue you.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.400
He commanded me

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.160
to take you into refuge with me.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.490
Dad.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.210
I still have no idea who hurt us.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.440
If you want to find out
who hurt you and your dad,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.440
the only way is to go to Emmaly.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.090
I am...

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.690
Khanin Assavadevathin.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.090
A body, charred beyond recognition,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.120
was found.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.210
Once the results are in,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.450
I will report to you
immediately, Your Majesty.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.830
No need to do that.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
That body is Thatdanai's.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.160
What did you just say?

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.730
Thatdanai has passed away,
Your Royal Highness.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.650
I hereby order your punishment

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.930
for neglecting your duty
to care for Khanin.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.960
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880
and confined,
prohibited from seeing him.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120
His Majesty has assigned this coach

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.280
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.000
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.690
Your Royal Highness...

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.600
Your Royal Highness!

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.600
Your Royal Highness!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.479
Your Royal Highness,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.720
can you hear me?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320
I want to entrust you with something.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.560
I wish to know

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.120
who stands against me.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.570
I haven't managed
to catch the culprit yet.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.550
I'll have someone look into it.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.329
But do you have any idea

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.040
who might be behind this?

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.400
It was taken at Heathrow Airport.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.770
If I were to guess,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.210
he's probably already in Emmaly.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.240
Thanks a lot.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.840
[Meet me in Assavadevathin]

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.520
Thank you, Wasin.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.640
This is impeccable
and truly magnificent.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.560
I am deeply grateful
to Your Majesty the King

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.080
for entrusting me with this duty.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.120
And I thank Chana

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.760
for introducing the technology to assist
with scoring in this archery match.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.440
In this round, I ask for your permission
to root for Khanin, Your Majesty.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.080
Thank you.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.680
Thank you.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.159
How about rooting for Ava,
the front-runner?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.240
She is unmatched
when it comes to archery.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.280
It's too soon to say that.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.120
Let's wait and see for ourselves.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.080
Please, Father.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.680
Welcome to the second round
of the Royal Competition.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.000
This round features an archery match.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.080
The competitors from all three clans
are now ready to compete.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.680
This match features
four different targets:

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.680
standard targets,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.700
birds,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.480
horses,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.400
and snakes,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.480
each with their own scoring value.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.280
Once the time is up,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.920
the competitor with the highest score

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.560
will be crowned
the winner of this round.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.440
All you have to do

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.520
is to get to the top.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.320
It is not fair anymore, Ava.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.440
You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.800
If you wish to change Emmaly,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.720
one way to do it

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.080
is to win the Competition.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.159
I'll do my best to win.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.799
If all competitors are ready,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.919
I shall now declare
the archery competition

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.360
officially underway.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680
Ten,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.040
nine,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.720
eight,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.000
seven,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200

three,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360
two,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.800
one,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.760
begin.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440
Sorry.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.000
I just took the last shot.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.000
What is happening?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.840
What's going on?

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.820
Smoke bombs.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.600
What's going on?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.560
Father...

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.000
Send someone out
to find Khanin immediately.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.880
Send the soldiers to the scene at once.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.000
What's going on, Wasin?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.480
Terrorism in Meenanagarin?
Is that possible?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.000
There has never been
any act of terrorism in my city.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.040
I ask for time to verify the facts.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.000
Please rest assured,
Your Majesty and Royal Highnesses.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.720
I won't allow my daughter
to be put in such danger.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.080
I believe my people
are on their way to the scene.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.320
My apologies, everyone.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.040
We are currently unaware
of what has happened in the arena.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.280
I kindly ask you
to proceed to a safe area.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.680
Please.

- Ava!

Are you okay?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.280
Watch out!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.320
These arrows are the same as ours.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640
It's a setup.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.440
They want to make it seem like

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.240
we turned on each other.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.920
Let's get out of here.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640
Can you get up?

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160
Let me help.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.320
Get on my back, can you?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.160
Yeah.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.040
You alright?

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.050
Go, Khanin.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.400
I'll see you at the designated spot.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.640
Your Royal Highness...

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.920
Father,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.520
I'm worried about Khanin's safety.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.240
No matter what, he must be safe.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.920
May I have your permission,
Your Majesty?

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.600
I apologize for my escape.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.200
You have fled. What made you return?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.760
Honestly, I had no intention to flee.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.640
But being constantly watched
made it difficult to perform my duties.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.320
Still, I have obeyed
your commands fully, Your Majesty,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.120
to pursue the perpetrator.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.640
Here is all the evidence
I have gathered.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080
Your Royal Highness?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.240
Make yourself at ease.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.360
That would be inappropriate.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.920
I wanted to meet you today
to talk about important matters.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.480
I will ensure your protection

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.520
if you agree to help me.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.280
Do you want me...

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.160
to help you?

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.520
Yes.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.319
You must keep this confidential.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.720
Do not reveal it to anyone,
not even His Majesty.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.900
I don't understand.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.119
Do you not trust His Majesty,
Your Royal Highness?

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.000
It's not that I don't trust him,

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.760
but everything I do
is to keep Khanin safe.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.120
I lost him once,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.960
and I cannot bear to lose him again.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.360
Are you implying that...

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.320
His Majesty holds no goodwill
toward Prince Khanin?

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.480
To my father,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.240
Assavadevathin comes
before everything else.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.280
Do it for Khanin.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.680
Join me in this.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.960
Prince Rachata is planning
to send a new coach to Prince Khanin.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.720
Prince Rachata?

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.720
He must be plotting something.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.400
There's no solid lead at the moment,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.800
but it's possible he wants information
or is planning an ambush.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.240
What's the name of that coach?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720
It's Joe.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.160
Please send me his profile.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:38.920
Okay.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680
I need your help.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440
With what?

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080
Coach Joe.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.080
He was once a soldier
serving Bhuchongpisut.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.000
Out of nowhere,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320
he became a top-tier fencer

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.880
in just a few months.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.880
Got it.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.680
At first,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.120
all suspicion pointed
to the Bhuchongpisuts.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.280
But once the truth came to light,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.720
it turned out

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.480
they were merely a scapegoat.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.560
Coach Joe's profile was fabricated.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.240
So it was an intentional attack.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.080
If you get caught,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.720
you're as good as gone.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.460
So please come with me.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.640
If nothing else,

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.640
do it for Prince Khanin.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.960
[Coach Joe Detained over Plot
to Poison Prince Khanin]

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.590
How did it turn out this way?

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.680
I'm confident nothing will reach you,
Your Royal Highness.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.960
You've merely followed
Prince Wasin's advice.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.640
Make sure everything is handled.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.960
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.480
[You were right;
Coach Joe serves under Prince Wasin]

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.440
My source sent me these.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.240
This forest is really perilous.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.000
It's full of wild animals

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.320
and countless traps.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.160
I'm noticing a lot of vulnerabilities
in this map.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.520
Seems like it's designed
for a terrorist attack.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.520
I never expected it...

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.080
to be Prince Wasin.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.160
Because he seems kind?

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360
You never know what's on someone's mind.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.600
What do you think he's doing this for?

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680
Power.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.600
Everyone's just hungry for power.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.080
In this freaking country,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.520
everyone should be equal by now.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.120
We're all human.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.840
What's the point of having power?

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.240
To put himself above everyone else.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.960
He also checked the storeroom today.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.880
Jeez,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.520
again and again?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.220
Yeah.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.440
If I didn't know things were calm,

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.080
I'd believe war was coming.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.280
Come on.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.920
Stop talking nonsense.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.920
Shit...

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040
The GPS...

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.520
[You were right;
my source spotted something off]

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.440
[Vedish: You were right;
my source spotted something off]

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.760
Soldiers,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.200
detain Prince Wasin.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.160
Follow me this way.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.080
Your Majesty and Royal Highnesses,

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.240
please proceed this way.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:40.810
All of you, please.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.850
This way.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.290
This way, please.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.810
Soldiers,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.080
detain Prince Wasin.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.080
Watch out!

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.310
Your Royal Highness!

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.720
- Ran...
- Your Royal Highness.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.440
Are you hurt, Your Royal Highness?

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.700
I'm okay.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.440
Are you injured anywhere?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
You're not hurt, right?

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.840
I'm totally alright,
Your Royal Highness.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.320
This pearl...

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.400
has a tracker in it.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.360
But Prince Wasin gave me this.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.280
Exactly.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.040
That's why I could locate you.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320
And if I could,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.520
so can...

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.160
the rebels.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.840
Are you implying...

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.400
Prince Wasin...

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.000
is behind the rebellion.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.480
Because he has no heir,

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.080
he chose to get rid of everyone else's?

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.040
If you want to uncover the truth,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.920
we need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.760
I'm not certain

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.360
what other traps may be in this forest.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.400
But Ava's injured.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360
I'm okay.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.440
Let's leave this place at once.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.080
This way, please.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.120
This way.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.600
Are we all going to be safe, Ran?

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.960
Both clans have been directed
to proceed to the designated spot.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.080
We shall meet again in Davin.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.210
Are you hurt, dear?

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.350
I'm unharmed, Father.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.480
Your Royal Highness, are you alright?

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800
I'm fine.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.560
Have our people arrived?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.280
The ship is almost here,
Your Royal Highness.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.840
You think you can escape me?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.240
What is it that you want?

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.320
Nothing!

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.240
I never wanted anything
from someone as selfish as you.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.040
You ripped my loved ones away

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.960
and tore my family apart.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.120
Wait, wait.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.480
Calm yourself.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.760
Let's talk nicely and calmly,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.320
and I shall grant you a pardon

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.040
and allow you to seek refuge abroad.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.520
I'm the one bringing you to justice.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.600
How many lives have you taken?

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.680
You probably don't even know

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.040
that it was your grandfather
who killed my family.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.520
So...

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.080
what matter brings you here today?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.280
My wife was born in Assavadevathin.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.960
She is currently deeply concerned
about the severely polluted air

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.600
near the mine, Your Majesty.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.440
Has your wife just returned
from Assavadevathin?

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.000
No, Your Majesty.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.720
But she was informed by her family.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.120
What makes you certain that it's real?

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.280
There is no reason to lie,
is there, Your Majesty?

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.080
Wow, how very optimistic of you.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.840
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty,

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.160
my family has told no lies.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.440
I beg you
to help the people, Your Majesty.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.360
How can I do that?

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.680
I humbly request that

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.800
you order the concessionaire company

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.240
to build containment pits for mine waste

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.120
to lessen the pollution

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:09.960
and protect the well-being
of the local people.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.880
Let's say
I have acknowledged your request.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.640
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.200
With your permission,
I shall take my leave.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.880
May you be blessed
with good health, Your Majesty.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.440
Thank you.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.440
We've come to ask
for your help, Rachata.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.800
We were hoping you could support

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.800
the proposed mining law.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.320
The proposed mining law?

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.600
Our inspection
of the gold mine in Assavadevathin

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.040
revealed a complete lack
of pollution control.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.960
So we're asking all clans

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.040
to propose a regulatory law
for mining operations.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.440
Certainly, I will lend my support.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.240
We appreciate that.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.160
I would like to ask for your help

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.000
to invent technology
that can reduce dust and pollution

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.480
as the people in Assavadevathin,

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.520
especially ones near the mine,
are suffering terribly from the issues.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800
Interesting.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.840
Here's a quick thought.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.960
Air purifiers should be able
to address that.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.160
It's quite an intriguing idea.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.400
My love...

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.840
My love,

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.880
I'm right here.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.560
Shall I inform the miners
right away, Your Majesty?

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800
No need.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.840
Understood, Your Majesty.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.440
My love...

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960
My love.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.160
My love!

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.320
My princess...

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.760
After the lung and allergy medicine
was introduced,

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.210
patient visits at Bhuchongpisut Hospital

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:42.800
have risen over 200 percent,
Your Royal Highness.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.040
This could be very profitable.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.200
So...

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.600
I'll have the development team
accelerate this project immediately.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.600
I will cause every one of you

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:43.390
pain and torment far beyond
what happened to my love.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.440
Announce to all

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.800
that Her Royal Highness has passed away
due to preeclampsia.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.760
When I declared why my wife died,

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.880
no one...

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.400
None of you even cared
if it was that disease.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.560
My wife died from lung cancer

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.560
because of your careless
mining operations.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.680
And now, you've got lung cancer, too.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.600
Yet, you've never even tried
to do anything.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.040
All you care about is the capitalists,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.600
whether they'll gain profit

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.800
or whether they'll support you.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.720
You only care if your family's power

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.200
will be threatened.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.920
You care nothing for the people,

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.840
nothing for the country.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.120
Go to hell.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.480
Your Majesty...

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.680
Why are you protecting him?

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.040
Don't you know he's the one
who caused your mother's death?

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.440
Stop! Drop the gun.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680
- Wait...
- Wirun?

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.680
I said, "Drop the gun."

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080
Guns down.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.480
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.520
- Your Majesty!
- Grandfather...

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.440
Your Royal Highness...

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.600
- Your Majesty...
- Father!

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.240
- Grandfather...
- Why, Wirun?

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.120
How does it feel to be betrayed
by the one you trusted most?

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.560
Try to understand me.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.920
My sister lost her life,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.840
and my whole family died
because of your mine.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.600
Is your wife Wirun's sister?

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.880
You just never cared about anyone.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.800
After all, blood is thicker than water,
isn't it?

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.160
Is this the reason

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.640
you took my side?

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.560
Intentional or not,

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.480
the outcome wouldn't change.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.200
Stop pretending to be the victim.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.280
Thanks to Wirun for the information.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.840
It gave me the opportunity
to seek revenge again.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.000
You should try Earl Grey,

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.080
the tea imported from the UK.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.960
As soon as I found out from Wirun

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
that Khanin was still alive,

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.760
- I sent my men to get rid of him.
- Go.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800
We need to change the plan.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.320
I'll reach out to you once we're there.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.600
Since the assassination attempt
in the UK failed,

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.600
I realized I had to separate
Charan from Khanin.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.040
Otherwise, the plan would never succeed.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.840
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.760
and confined,
prohibited from seeing him.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.160
So you want me
to lose the Competition, Grandfather?

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.960
Your Royal Highness...

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.350
And I did it.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
His Majesty has assigned this coach

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.160
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.050
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.200
But Joe messed it up,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.440
so I turned to Rachata instead.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.800
Who do you work for?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.080
Kill him.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.480
His Majesty the King!

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.000
Turned out he was a coward.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.680
Why can't we do anything?

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.480
You think you can take them down

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.800
without any proof?

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.200
Didn't have the guts to do anything.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:15.200
I had no choice
but to finish it myself today.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.040
But since I couldn't hurt you directly,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.480
I had to hurt the one
you placed your hopes in.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.440
Prince Wasin,

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.880
Wirun...

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.080
I understand you all,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.640
but killing us won't do any good.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.680
Stop, Khanin. There's no need.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.000
I am the King.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.200
They can't lay a hand on me.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.720
Are you sure?

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:22.640
- Your Majesty, Prince Tharin...
- Let's go!

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680
Thatdanai?

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.190
Freeze! Don't move.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.720
This way, please.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.440
Dad...

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.280
Khanin!

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.200
- Khanin!
- Dad...

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.400
Nin...

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.520
Khanin.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.080
How have you been?

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.000
- I missed you.
- I'm okay.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.420
You should go now.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.360
We'll talk later.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.360
Charan, take him.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400
- This way.
- Let's go.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.360
- Your Royal Highness!
- Watch out!

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.560
Chakri...

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.680
- Chakri!
- Chakri!

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.440
- Chakri!
- Chakri...

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.070
Chakri, hey!

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:48.960
Chakri...

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.960
Chakri!

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.600
Ran, what do we do?

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.080
- Chakri!
- Chakri...

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.840
- Chakri...
- Chakri...

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.260
Chakri,

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.500
I'm here to see you.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.800
About what Prince Wasin said,

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.680
can you tell me about that?

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.120
For the Competition's archery match,
taking place in Meenanagarin...

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.340
Even if something happened to the King,

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.920
wouldn't the Competition
still has to go on?

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.640
Soon,

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.960
we shall rise
and rule over this country.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.640
I believe we have an opportunity
to bring about change.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.200
You must win the fencing match.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.880
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.480
His Majesty...

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.080
♫Let love be our guide,♫

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.800
♫Let our hearts unite♫

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:44.440
♫From now on,
I'll let my heart decide♫

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.800
♫If the world won't take our side,♫

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:57.200
♫I'll leave their voices far behind♫

♫From now on, it's you and I♫

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:11.320
♫Forget the rest,
place your hand in mine♫

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.800

WEBVTT

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.800
I... I think that's what I meant.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.800
I like Kon-chan.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
Just kidding! I was messing with you.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.240
I'll head out first, then.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.300
Hey! Hayakawa.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.840
Was what you said back then really a lie?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.470
What happened back then...

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:35.700
If it wasn't a lie, would
you seriously consider it?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You go ahead and sleep!
I'm going to take a shower.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Hayakawa.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.200
It's really great to see you again.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.600
I originally planned to keep my feelings
for Kon-chan sealed away in my heart.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't look back...

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.400
"Depth of Field"

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.200
(Episode 6)

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.647
Were you just testing it out earlier?

00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:01.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.100
What are you doing?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.500
There was a bit of a mistake just now.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.600
- I've been giving it my all in practice.
- Alright, alright!

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800
Hayakawa, don't
overdo it with the practice.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.700
Hey! Take a break for a bit.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.300
(Konno: Want to grab something to eat?)

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.200
(Hayakawa: Sure.)

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.600
(Konno: My friend wants to meet you.)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.500
Friend...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.900
I really am such an idiot.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.700
Still holding on to a bit of hope.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.500
You haven't changed
at all since high school.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.899
Sorry for asking you out all of a sudden.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.900
Not at all...

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.500
You two are...?

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.450
We were college classmates.

00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:51.411
Since our student ID numbers were
close, we naturally got to know each other.

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:56.050
Yeah, that may be true, but Konno is the kind of
person who really takes photography seriously.

00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:58.117
So I just wanted to get to know him.

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:01.145
- That's the first time I've heard you say that.
- And... it feels like he's really well-connected?

00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:02.917
- I don't have any connections.
- Sure you do.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.229
Introduce your father to me!

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.799
Introduce you to my dad? Are
you planning to fly to New York?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.946
Hey! Wanna go check it out?

00:04:08.947 --> 00:04:10.999
No way! You should just take me with you!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.187
Because New York has Broadway
and the Statue of Liberty.

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:15.977
It's basically one of the
hottest spots for photos!

00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:18.199
- Have you been there?
- Yeah, I have.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.411
I want to go too!

00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.572
If you take photos there, I bet you
could attract some models, right?

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.300
Ah! Speaking of models.
Hayakawa, could you take a look at this for me?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200
This is the one.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.076
This... is this Miss Nan's work?

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.100
That's right.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300
That's impressive.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800
That's amazing.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.000
Actually, I really like it.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.965
Hey! I'm so happy!

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:55.800
Actually, I invited you out today because
I wanted you to be my model, Hayakawa.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.000
Model?

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.457
Yes! It fits my image perfectly!

00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:03.285
And I keep having the urge
to shoot Hayakawa again.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.176
You get it, right?

00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:04.888
The urge...

00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:06.825
Sometimes you
just have that feeling.

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:09.300
By the way, which
one's your favorite?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.426
- I really like this one.
- Right? It's great, isn't it?

00:05:12.427 --> 00:05:13.812
How did you shoot this?

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.276
Looks like it's in a puddle, doesn't it?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.759
This is the one.
I used the puddle to take this shot.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.255
See, there's a reflection.
That way, it's handled really cleanly.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.175
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:25.612
- Sorry about that.
- Coming right up.

00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:28.100
- Give me a stronger highball.
- Sure.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.817
You can take your time thinking
about what happened earlier, no rush.

00:05:33.818 --> 00:05:36.870
You can really take it easy.
No need to feel any pressure.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.200
I'm counting on you.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.026
- Which round is this?
- The second round.

00:05:45.526 --> 00:05:48.899
Is Konno always like that when he's drunk?

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.001
If he drinks too much,
he definitely does!

00:05:51.026 --> 00:05:54.947
He smiles about eighty percent more
than usual, and he often forgets things.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Konno, time to go home.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.200
Your place is right here, so if you miss the
last train, it actually works out pretty well!

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600
It's actually a bit of a hassle for me
when you come by so often, you know.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600
Here, have a drink.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.300
Sorry... I drank too much.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.500
Oh no... I'm so sleepy.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.000
Aren't you going to take a shower?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.500
Still the same, huh.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.300
Kon-chan...

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.800
Sorry.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.700
- Hey! Konno.
- Don't call me that.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.440
Just hearing that makes me mad.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.603
Huh, with a girl? Konno?

00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:29.183
Well, how should I put this... I just kind
of went along with it after getting drunk...

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.000
Hmm... I've never seen it myself!
Haven't even heard about it.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.100
By the way, what's the relationship
between Miss Nan and Konno?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Huh, us?
No, no, that's not possible.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600
I see.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.900
Once again... you're
thinking "maybe," aren't you?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.500
Honestly, this probably isn't the best time
for him to be in a relationship, right?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.700
What do you mean?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.700
See, he's about to leave
Japan soon, isn't he?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.767
- What?
- Huh? You haven't heard yet?

00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:14.033
He was planning to take a break from school for
a while to help out because his dad is overseas.

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:17.600
Didn't we say yesterday
that it was in New York?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.000
So I don't think he's planning
on dating anyone right now.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.800
I see.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.000
Sorry, I thought Konno
had already told you.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.480
After all, it's been three years
since we last saw each other.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.440
Alright then, talk to you later. Goodbye.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.300
So warm.

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.119
Absolutely stunning today.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.900
- Hold on, hold on.
- What's up?

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.200
- Hey! Isn't that awesome?
- It really is!

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.300
Hayakawa.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.567
- Sorry.
- Oh no.

00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:14.000
- What's up?
- Look.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.381
This Sunday, someone from Nouvelle
Records wants to meet and have a chat!

00:11:19.382 --> 00:11:22.000
I heard they came to see
our performance last time.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.699
- Uh, that!
- That!

00:11:25.723 --> 00:11:27.599
- Huh?
- That's awesome!

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:30.679
How about we pick a place
and have a strategy meeting?

00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:34.542
Coming, coming, coming!

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:42.100
- Hayakawa! Hurry up, hurry up!
- Coming! Coming!

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.000
(I want to return your key.)

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.100
Sorry about the keys. I heard
you're heading to New York.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.500
You can head home early today.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.100
By the way, is it really
necessary to work this late?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.500
At the very least, let me
help clean up a bit before I go.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.700
Alright, I'll leave it to you then.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.300
Good job.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.500
Good job.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.903
What's up, are you two a couple?

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:39.957
No.

00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:42.400
So... is it someone you want
to be in a relationship with?

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.750
Just friends.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.700
There was a bit of a pause just now.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.000
You don't have to hide it, it's okay.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.600
I've been through that myself before.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.400
Is this... the kind of liking that comes
from friendship? Or is it something more...?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.200
I used to think we were just friends.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.100
Even though he's a bit clumsy.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.800
But I like the way he gives it his all.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
I just want to be there
by his side, watching him.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.800
But we were apart for too long...

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:10.500
What got everyone started
with music in the first place?

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.243
I was influenced by my older brother.

00:17:13.443 --> 00:17:16.100
Hayakawa comes from a family of musicians.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.300
I see.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.099
So have you been living with
music ever since you were a kid?

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.139
I also had a period when I
stepped away from music.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.450
I made up my mind never to touch it again.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.300
So you had a time like that too?

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.400
Why do you want to start over again?

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.000
That's...

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Someone once told me to be
honest with my own feelings.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.500
He told me, you can
make choices for yourself.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.400
Yeah! It's really lucky to
meet someone like that.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800
Yes.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:19.100
Hayakawa, isn't it thanks to that person
that you're able to live so honestly now?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.880
Being honest with myself...

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.440
- Thank you all for coming today.
- Thank you for giving us this opportunity.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.500
Ah! I'm so nervous.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.700
I feel pretty good.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.009
Right, Hayakawa!

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:44.582
- Hayakawa?
- Ah! Sorry.

00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:46.217
I'm heading out first.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:47.218
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.900
Miss Nan, is Konno with you right now?

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:54.499
I have something I want to say to him.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.000
Konno has already left for New York.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400
Why...

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.100
So cold.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.800
(Strawberry milk)

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.700
Why are you already drinking?
We haven't even toasted yet!

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.500
Cheers!

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.500
Sorry.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.040
I'm going to start eating.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.900
I heard you're heading to New York.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.500
I heard it from Miss Nan.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.000
I... was planning to tell you
when I returned the keys.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.100
Sorry, I'm the one who
didn't reply to your messages.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.700
Actually, weren't you
supposed to leave today?

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.300
Yeah.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200
But...

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.140
it's been changed to tomorrow night.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.200
Because I want to talk with you.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.700
I want to talk with you too.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.600
Thank you for everything
back in high school.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.800
That's why I'm still making music now.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400
Thank you.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.000
That's what I should've told
you first when we met again.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.376
In the end, it still feels
like I'm avoiding you.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400
Sorry.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.700
Don't apologize.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.500
That was the result of your own hard work.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.700
By the way,

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.500
I never expected you to act
like that when you're drunk.

00:24:00.604 --> 00:24:03.307
You probably wouldn't remember
anyway after drinking that much.

00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:04.534
I remember.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.500
But Miss Nan said you get
amnesia when you're drunk.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.500
I remember.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.500
Kon-chan, you...

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:37.500
Do you kiss anyone when you're drunk?

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.000
I don't kiss just anyone.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.320
I only did it because it was you.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.400
Alright!

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.300
Let me confess my feelings again, to
make up for what happened three years ago.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.500
Alright!

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800
Kon-chan.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.300
I like Kon-chan in that same way.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.000
This time... I'm not lying.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200
Even last time... I wasn't lying, either.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.400
Me too...

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.000
I like you in the same way.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.300
I always thought... I
had to keep it hidden.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.400
No more lying from now on, okay?

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.400
Yeah.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.700
Alright.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.500
What's up?

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:09.000
Hot pot, can we pause for a moment?

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.300
Huh?

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.400
I want three years' worth of kisses.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.800
And for all the kisses we won't
get to share in the days ahead, too.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.200
I really miss this.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.000
I've heard this song here before, too.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.160
Yeah.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.260
Uh... this...

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.600
This song was inspired by Kon-chan.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.500
Don't call me gross.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:49.500
- Ugh~ That's so gross! So gross!
- Are you even listening to me?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.427
Hey, want to go grab something to eat?

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:27.418
Not bad.

00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:28.554
What do you want to eat?

00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:29.555
Meat.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800
Not bad!

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.600
I want to have ginger pork.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.179
Kon-chan, you're treating us, right?

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.180
Alright.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:53.000

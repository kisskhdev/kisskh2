(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.879
The young escort master of Qinghe
is back.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.799
Just you today?

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.480
The rest are worn out

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.239
and still resting.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.640
Two finely minced pork buns
and a bowl of rice congee.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.439
Thank you, madam.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:02.920
Sure.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.519
Please come in.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.719
Madam.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:12.520
Here you go.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:13.439
Sure.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.719
Come again.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.240
Alright.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.120
Let me take a look at that.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:22.960
Alright.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.159
Madam,

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.360
I'll pay in full.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.240
I'm not eating.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.280
Wait.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400
You're leaving like this?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.599
Did you see clearly?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.000
That was Gu Bingyu?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.540
(Laifu Storehouse)

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:20.680
Are we going in?

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.830
This place is crowded,
and the routes are intricate.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.080
Go check if there's a back door.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.000
Got it.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.879
Two bowls of tea.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.840
Coming.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:34.719
Please sit.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.840
Here's your tea.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.360
There's no back door.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.400
Only one exit.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.520
Has he come out yet?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.919
It's broad daylight.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.560
What could take so long?

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.479
Should we go in and take a look?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.040
Excuse me.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.759
Which room is
Escort Gu Bingyu staying in?

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.120
Who are you?

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.000
We're his friends.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.720
We got separated and came to meet him.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.000
Gentlemen,

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.920
follow me.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.879
Thank you.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.439
Take the stairs to the second floor.

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.240
"Heaven" Room.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:36.680
Split up.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.120
No signs that the window was opened.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.600
No footprints on the sill either.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.519
He didn't leave through the window.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.920
You're good at this, huh?

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.920
I watched dramas too, okay?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.319
So, where did Gu Bingyu go?

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.720
Have you seen a guest

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.639
about this tall?

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:58.560
No.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.279
Long face.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.920
No.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.959
Let's go.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.260
(Wedding Invitation,
Du Residence, Cangzhou)

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.680
Gu Bingyu!

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.319
Gu Bingyu!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.600
Why the rush, Pu?

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.680
What happened?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.920
Tell me honestly.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.480
Did Huaijin

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.480
really die during the escort robbery
three years ago?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.360
Of course.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.720
I watched her...

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.160
I watched her breathe her last
in my arms.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:43.839
How could that be fake?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.040
I just...

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.519
I just

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.279
saw her in the city.

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:01.639
Impossible.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.760
You must've mistaken someone else.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.480
No.

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.879
I couldn't be wrong.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.639
I may forget anyone or anything,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.839
but her face

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:20.480
only grows clearer

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.279
with time.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.839
Pu,

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.240
you should rest.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.439
Didn't the physician say

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.319
love sickness made someone ill,
and accumulated worry became pain?

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.680
That can cause hallucinations.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.639
If this continues,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.439
I fear your inner demons
will overcome you.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:47.279
I told you I wasn't mistaken!

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.399
Why won't you believe me?

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:53.480
You're her brother.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.439
Don't you want her to still be alive?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.160
Fine.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.879
If you don't believe me,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.680
let's go to Guangji Apothecary.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.000
She might pass by there again.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.399
Pu.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.199
Let's go find her.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:10.600
Pu.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.920
Let's go now.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.199
Pu Jingtang, wake up!

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.399
Gu Huaijin is dead.

00:08:24.614 --> 00:08:25.959
She's dead.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.159
Please.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.519
Forget her.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:39.919
No.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.360
I don't want to wake up.

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:50.919
Revive the Gu family

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.480
and restore its honor.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.799
It's enough
that you alone stay clear-headed.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.519
What am I?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.639
I'm just a lodger who doesn't even
deserve to guard her grave.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.279
I can do nothing.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:24.120
Aside from mourning,

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:30.200
all I can do is sit there every day,
playing sorrowful tunes that never end.

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:41.559
Within it, there lives an ancient tune.

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:46.120
Yet few today truly appreciate it.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.000
Sir, I would gladly play it,

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:57.960
but would you care to listen?

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:04.000
Sir, I would gladly play it,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.399
but would you care to listen?

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:38.840
Set off.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:47.120
I didn't see Mr. Gu at all.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.120
Gu Huaijin.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:24.360
You finally show yourself.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.879
Or should I call you

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.879
Gu Bingyu?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.679
You?

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.480
He?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.639
The same person?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.799
Liuqing Comb can shift yin and yang.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.240
You used it to turn into a man

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:50.879
to take your brother's place

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.759
and become
the head of the escort agency.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.500
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.990
At the inn earlier today,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.799
you changed from a man into a woman.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.960
I didn't notice at first.

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:04.879
Not until I found an empty cloth bundle
in the room.

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:07.399
What used to be inside

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.000
should've been women's clothes, right?

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.399
You think you can identify me
just by a bundle?

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:19.279
The butler at the Gu Residence
would recognize you.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.840
You were afraid he saw you,

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.679
so you waited
until the escort team left,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.159
then secretly returned
to Gu Bingyu's room.

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:27.120
Shall I call him over to confirm it?

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:27.879
Shut up.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.200
Who are you, really?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.759
Miss, let's talk calmly.

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:32.320
You're not a ruthless person.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:33.679
And we mean no harm.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.320
This Liuqing Comb belonged
to a friend of mine.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.519
He was caught in a family struggle

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.799
and died in a fire.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.840
His home was burned to ruins,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.639
and many heirlooms

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:45.879
were lost in the fire.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:48.480
The reason we've been searching for you

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.600
is only to take Liuqing Comb back.

00:12:59.039 --> 00:12:59.879
I see.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:02.279
You also carry a feud.

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:05.559
You want to help your friend
restore his family.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.180
(Memorial Tablet of
the Late Brother Gu Bingyu)

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:46.720
Bingyu!

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:56.840
Watch out!

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.639
Bingyu!

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.120
Bingyu.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.440
Bingyu.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.879
Bingyu.

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:34.679
Bingyu.

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:36.000
Bingyu.

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:37.240
Huaijin.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.159
Bingyu.

00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:48.200
This comb

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:51.559
is called Liuqing.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:55.639
I got it from a stranger.

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.200
Legend has it that

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.320
this comb can turn yin into yang

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.120
and yang into yin.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.080
It once helped a woman

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.399
to become a general on the battlefield.

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.120
Huaijin.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.120
Why are all the men
so foolish and incompetent,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.519
no match for a woman like Tiying?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.320
Remember.

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:32.480
Protect the Gu's clear reputation.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.759
You can do it.

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:42.039
Bingyu.

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:44.399
Bingyu, don't die.

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:45.440
Bingyu.

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.000
Bingyu.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.919
Bingyu.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.679
Bingyu.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.960
You're such a remarkable woman.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.279
Heaven never lets the persistent down.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.599
I've finally found the mastermind
behind the escort robbery back then.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.240
Since we're in the same situation,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.359
could you return the comb

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.799
to us?

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:41.640
Please forgive me.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.039
I still have an unfinished matter.

00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:44.759
Please stay here for now.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.680
I still need Liuqing Comb.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.759
Once it's done,

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:49.519
I may personally return it to you.

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:50.400
My apologies.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.960
She speaks politely,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.960
but she fights without mercy.

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:17.680
That unfinished matter

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:20.160
must be taking revenge on her enemy.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.880
Enough talk.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.150
Let's get out of here first.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:26.039
She locked the door.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.880
The window won't open either.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.759
Could there be a secret passage?

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.319
Have you seen a guest

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:42.240
about this tall?

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:43.400
No.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:44.359
Long face.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.519
(Wedding Invitation,
Du Residence, Cangzhou)

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.200
Stop looking.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:52.599
I know where she's going.

00:18:52.599 --> 00:18:53.079
Where?

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:55.599
Cangzhou.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:57.759
We can't even get out of here. Cangzhou?

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:17.200
Let's go.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.960
Where to?

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:22.440
The Du Residence.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.180
(Du Residence)

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.759
(Du Wenhua, former Governor of Cangzhou)

00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:44.680
My Lord,

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:47.160
the ginseng soup has been tasted.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.279
Also,

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.599
Master Du is requesting an audience.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.960
Let him in.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.820
(Grand Coordinator,
adopted son of Du Wenhua)

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:02.920
Father.

00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:06.079
Well,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.359
it's so early.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.119
What's the matter?

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.880
The wedding arrangements

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:15.480
are nearly complete.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.519
Everyone in the family

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.279
hopes

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:21.359
you'll take the seat of honor.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.839
Lian is the descendant of the Du family

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.079
and your only grandson.

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:28.759
He wishes

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.519
to offer you a cup of gratitude tea.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.559
This soup

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.359
is unclean.

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:46.559
You want me

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:50.200
to step out that door.

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:53.200
But you know it yourself.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.640
Morality and filial duty

00:20:58.519 --> 00:20:59.880
mean nothing to me.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.960
Since leaving the palace,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.480
you've been my adopted son
for over forty years.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.920
Have we ever eaten

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.279
at the same table?

00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:18.279
I've lived so cautiously all my life.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.960
Why should I break the habit

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.400
now?

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.559
Father,

00:21:29.839 --> 00:21:31.720
I've followed you for many years.

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:35.119
My loyalty is carved into my bones.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.920
I truly hope you'll see

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.380
the Du family prosper

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.240
with all the generations
united under one roof.

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:50.400
Father,

00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:52.680
you're the true master of the Du family.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.440
No matter

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.319
how high I rise,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.359
I'll never reach
even a slight fraction of

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.039
your standing at court.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.759
Stop.

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:27.799
I'll drink it now.

00:22:28.599 --> 00:22:29.440
It's clean now.

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:35.519
Please come in.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.839
(Du Residence)

00:22:37.839 --> 00:22:38.759
Please come in.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.519
Did you find anything?

00:23:17.519 --> 00:23:18.279
Yes.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.599
There's a lot of food today.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.240
This is especially good. Try it.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.119
And you?

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:28.240
Did you see that chubby man
carrying two blades?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.319
Steady steps.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.720
And that tall one.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.440
His fists are bigger than your face.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.799
That's normal.

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:36.680
My face is small.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.759
And that red-clad woman.
Her face is full of killing intent.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.319
That short one.
His qinggong is impressive.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.119
Every one of them is a master.

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:46.279
Have you ever seen a wedding

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.640
with this many experts?

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200
Looks like

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.559
today's wedding banquet
is anything but ordinary.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.240
Old Master Du has arrived!

00:23:58.079 --> 00:23:58.980
Please watch your step.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.039
Careful.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.000
- Congratulations, Old Master Du.
- Congratulations, Old Master Du.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.039
On this auspicious day,

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:13.279
the Du Residence celebrates great joy.

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:17.119
Perform the dance and bring blessings.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.400
Father, look.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.960
I invited them.

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:24.440
What's that?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.960
This is Nuo dance.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.880
It's to ward off evil and disease

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.319
and summon good fortune.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.480
They're rich indeed.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.000
It's said the Nuo dance
can quell dark spirits.

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.000
All demons

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.000
have fled in fear.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.559
You're right, Father.

00:25:23.599 --> 00:25:24.799
Excellent!

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:25.890
- Right!
- Right!

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.480
- Good!
- Good!

00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:33.119
The Gu family of Qinghe

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.519
comes to congratulate Old Master Du
on this marriage alliance.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.920
Is that

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.359
Miss Gu?

00:25:59.039 --> 00:25:59.759
Father.

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:22.279
The Gu family

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:26.720
is clever enough to be undone
by their own cleverness.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.119
From your very first move,

00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:33.680
every trace was under my control.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.839
I've been waiting for this moment.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.680
Take him away.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.279
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.039
Everyone.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.839
Everyone.

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:54.359
No need to panic.

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:56.200
This intruder merely has

00:26:56.279 --> 00:27:00.960
a trivial grudge with the Du family.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:03.119
It was just a minor incident.

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:06.680
It won't affect the wedding.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.839
Today is a fine day.

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:14.319
We have fine brew.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.319
Son.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.519
Yes, Father.

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.359
You're right, Father.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.039
The auspicious hour

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.319
has arrived.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.240
Let's go inside.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:27.079
Yes.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.200
Watch your step.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.119
Guests, please take your seats.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.839
She's gone now.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.359
What do we do?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.480
Gu Huaijin has been hidden
and planning for years.

00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:44.519
She wouldn't act so rashly.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.519
Let's go in first.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.559
The bride arrives.

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:22.640
The auspicious hour begins.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.440
Husband and wife, bow.

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:29.599
May the couple live in harmony,

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:32.200
and forever as one.

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:35.880
Rise.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.759
Second bow.

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:41.839
May their descendants flourish
for generations to come.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.200
Rise.

00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:50.000
Third bow to honor the elders.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.000
Bow.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.319
What's going on?

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:02.680
What's wrong with her?

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.920
Why isn't she bowing?

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.359
Die!

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.759
Go get the horses.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.920
Kill her.

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:35.880
No!

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.599
Don't move.

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:41.400
Who are you?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.079
I'm Gu Huaijin
from Qinghe Escort Agency,

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:46.200
whose family was destroyed

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.680
by Du Wenhua's scheme.

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:52.079
Du Wenhua, I've waited for this day
to come a long time.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.780
The injustice has finally
been overturned.

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:56.200
The authorities hastily closed the case
as a bandit robbery.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.559
I always knew something was wrong.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:58.400
Ridiculous!

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:02.240
I was the governor of Cangzhou.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.240
Why would I rob a small escort agency?

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.440
Because that escort

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:10.319
was never an ordinary one.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.640
Cangzhou embezzled funds
under the name of disaster relief.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.680
The imperial court ordered the ledgers
to be sent to the capital for inspection.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.559
So, the former governor

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:24.759
assigned the task to
the best escort agency,

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.319
the Gu Escort Agency.

00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:29.400
This was a conspiracy to deceive
those above and below.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:30.920
And Du Wenhua

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.990
(Gu Escort Agency)
was the mastermind

00:30:32.002 --> 00:30:33.000
(Gu Escort Agency)
behind the murder and robbery.

00:30:35.319 --> 00:30:35.839
Miss.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.519
Miss,

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:37.880
calm down.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.839
Look,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.240
this courtyard
is full of experts and soldiers.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.599
If you kill him,

00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:44.440
you won't leave here alive.

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:45.780
There's no need to threaten me.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.880
If I dared come here today,

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:49.839
I never planned on leaving alive.

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:51.480
No...

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.319
Father!

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.480
Old Master!

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:25.880
Father!

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.279
Careful.

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:40.200
Why are you here?

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.640
I came for revenge.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.240
Why are you so foolish?

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:44.960
Our fate hasn't ended yet.

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.559
How could I forget?

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:48.440
Your hatred

00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:50.000
is mine.

00:31:58.839 --> 00:31:59.319
Father,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.720
save me!

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.599
Stop!

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:03.039
Stop!

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.640
Lian.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.279
Sir.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.559
Please don't hurt my child.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680
Tell them to step back.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.759
Alright.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:10.599
Step back.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.160
Step back.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.240
Step back!

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:14.200
Don't be afraid.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:14.720
Father.

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:15.720
Mother.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.960
We may not

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.200
get out of here.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.319
The last sight of this lifetime

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.920
is you in red bridal robes.

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.759
That's enough for me

00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:30.799
to see this.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.559
I have

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.279
no more regrets.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.559
No.

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:39.680
We can't die

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.200
on our enemy's ground.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.599
I'll take you away from here.

00:32:45.599 --> 00:32:46.279
Calm down.

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:47.400
Help!

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.200
I'm here.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.200
Make them step back.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.039
Alright.

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:51.240
Quick. Step back.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.480
Move aside.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.119
Step back.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.160
Don't be afraid.

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:55.720
Save me, Father.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.559
I'm here.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.240
Don't move.

00:32:59.359 --> 00:32:59.920
Father.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.119
Mother.

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:02.279
Why help me?

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:04.119
What I want is still in your hands.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.200
Tell them to move aside.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.039
Come here.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.559
All of you, come here.

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:13.759
Come on.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.240
Don't be afraid.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:15.960
Father.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.200
I'm here.

00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:17.799
Mother.

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:18.680
Don't be afraid, Lian.

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:19.519
I'm here.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.480
Bizhi.

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:23.599
Come on.

00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:24.319
Get on the horse.

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:25.200
You go first.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.759
Father.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:31.480
Don't be afraid, Lian. I'm here.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.920
Lian.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:37.839
Father.

00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:38.519
After them!

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:47.160
Go.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.820
(Tomb of the Late Sister Gu Huaijin)

00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:03.199
Thank you for helping me

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.079
fulfill my last wish.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.119
Don't mention it.

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:13.480
This should be returned as well.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Miss Gu,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.320
do you need to use it one last time?

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:25.480
I've thought it through.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.679
I won't live on
using my brother's identity anymore.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.360
I don't know what will become
of the Gu Escort Agency,

00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:36.760
but it's time to face reality.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.200
"One shouldn't fear the changes
under heaven.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.850
One shouldn't blindly follow
ancestral rules.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.490
One shouldn't be deterred
by complaints of others."

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:46.079
This is what Jingtang taught me.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.079
Miss Gu,

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:52.960
I want to tell you something.

00:35:54.199 --> 00:35:55.079
In the future,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.360
women can achieve great things

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.400
and shoulder
great responsibilities like men.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.599
You don't have to become someone's wife

00:36:04.519 --> 00:36:06.000
to live freely

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.119
and openly.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.280
Really?

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.440
That would be wonderful.

00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:23.239
Take care.

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:24.119
You too.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.559
Do you know what you just did...

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.280
I know.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.840
Explosive bottles are dangerous.

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:50.320
I won't do it again.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.360
I was desperate to save them.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.519
I saved Gu Huaijin to keep Liuqing Comb.

00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:59.800
I saved you so we could go home safely.

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:01.000
Besides,

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.800
you're my boss, after all.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.960
I meant to say

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.679
what you said back there was good.

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.280
Really?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.180
This is the first time
you've praised me.

00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:14.719
You said something other

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.990
than "At least
you didn't get hurt this time."

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.119
That deserves praise.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:20.960
Boss,

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.840
I'll work harder from now on.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.760
And then?

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.559
What happened to Miss Gu?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.280
Then,

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.360
she had her own path to walk.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.039
And I had things I needed to do.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.480
That's so heartless.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.480
What?

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.199
I hate stories without endings.

00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:46.039
Couldn't you have gone back to check

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:48.559
if Miss Gu inherited
the family business,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.000
get married,

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:51.519
or become a nun?

00:37:52.519 --> 00:37:54.239
She didn't offend you in any way.

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.800
Can't you at least wish her well?

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.519
Besides, this isn't a huaben.

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:00.039
There are no endings in real life.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.360
No.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.199
I need an ending.

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:04.800
Alright.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.360
How about this?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.159
From then on,

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.519
a ghost-masked escort appeared
in the martial world.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.239
Though slender in build,

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:16.320
their strikes were swift and ruthless.

00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:18.760
With that eerie, cold mask,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.519
they struck terror into every bandit,

00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:23.000
earning both fear and reverence.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.480
How's that ending?

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.239
That's more like it.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.840
Here.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.480
Still, I think

00:38:29.559 --> 00:38:30.760
Miss Gu

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.079
is a bit like you.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.880
Really?

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:34.639
Of course.

00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:37.960
Miss Gu was beautiful,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.260
but she didn't need to wear
fancy ornaments or clothes.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.320
But when it comes to
dominating presence,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.599
that mischievous and willful look,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.320
you outdo her by far.

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:51.480
What do you mean, I don't need
fancy ornaments or clothes?

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:53.679
Bizhi, you're unusually talkative today.

00:38:55.679 --> 00:38:56.360
Do you like it?

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.159
Gold-inlaid jade.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.719
Butterfly hairpin.

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:02.599
Yes.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.639
I searched this for you.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.320
What I wanted was a
gold-inlaid jade dragonfly hairpin.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:09.719
You shouldn't make such a basic mistake.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.890
Is there really a difference?

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.760
Dragonflies and butterflies are insects.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:15.719
I'll let it slide this time.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.119
But if you bring the wrong one again,

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:19.599
I'll punish you severely.

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.000
Thank you, Market Lord.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.199
Consider this butterfly hairpin
as my apology.

00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:25.840
I'll find you a dragonfly hairpin
as soon as possible.

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:27.559
That's more like it.

00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:36.280
You're still bringing him along.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.679
I need some more time

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.400
to investigate his life history.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.480
Let me warn you.

00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:46.480
Time travelers should avoid attachments.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.480
Otherwise, history may repeat itself.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.519
Tuanzi,

00:39:58.519 --> 00:39:59.000
spit it out.

00:39:59.079 --> 00:39:59.559
Spit it out.

00:39:59.639 --> 00:40:00.159
Spit it out.

00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:02.000
- Chun Ge, I brought you food.
- Wait.

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:04.920
My hostage is in its mouth.

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:05.840
Spit it out.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.239
Tuanzi.

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:07.079
Tuanzi, please.

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:08.239
Spit it out.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.599
Tuanzi, spit it out.

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:10.880
Tuanzi, I'll kneel for you, okay?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.440
Tuanzi.

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:14.239
Right. I'll trade this with you, okay?

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:15.079
That one doesn't taste good.

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:15.960
Tuanzi,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.840
let go.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.519
Spit it out.

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:18.079
I'll do it.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.039
Tuanzi,

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:20.840
let go.

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:21.800
Let go.

00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:23.440
Here.

00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:25.559
Why are you so naughty?

00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:26.400
Where's the head?

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.480
Uh.

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:30.079
Tuanzi, let go.

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:32.679
Why are you so naughty?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.559
Here you go.

00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:41.360
I'll buy you a new one.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.840
No need.

00:40:44.199 --> 00:40:45.519
I'll just glue it back.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.760
Su Beilu, why are you back so late?

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.880
If you hadn't returned, Tuanzi
would've torn Chun Ge's place apart.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.000
We couldn't stop it.

00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:52.719
Let's clean up the mess and eat.

00:40:52.719 --> 00:40:53.440
Yes.

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:54.400
Wait.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.679
Go over there.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.800
Go.

00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:00.159
Come on.

00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:00.719
Back.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:01.840
Back.

00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:06.719
Thank you.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:09.400
Su Beilu,

00:41:09.519 --> 00:41:10.480
is this you?

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:11.679
That's Chun Ge.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.719
I'm the one next to him.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.320
Let's have some congee.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.239
Bei.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.039
Wait.

00:41:18.039 --> 00:41:19.000
Wipe your hands.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:19.760
Here.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.400
I'll help you.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.079
Come.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.360
Mom,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.599
you're blocking my comic.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.599
Later,

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.360
finish your congee

00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:38.840
and do your homework.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.599
Did you hear me?

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:40.679
Alright, Mrs. Chun.

00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:42.800
Did you hear me?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.840
Good boy.

00:41:45.199 --> 00:41:46.119
Drink up.

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:50.440
Mom nags me all the time.

00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:52.599
So annoying.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.039
You don't know how lucky you are.

00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:17.079
Today is October 13th, 2005.

00:42:17.239 --> 00:42:18.760
China's independently developed

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.760
Shenzhou 6 human spaceflight

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.519
was successfully launched yesterday

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:25.039
from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:26.800
The estimated flight time is five days.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.039
The spaceflight will first enter orbit
at an inclination of 42.4 degrees.

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:29.880
Bei,

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.000
are you tired?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.950
- Do you want to get some sleep?
- I'm not sleepy.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.280
I'm folding a dog.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.320
You really like dogs.

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:38.199
How about this?

00:42:38.199 --> 00:42:41.280
If you do well this semester,
we'll let you have one.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.079
Alright?

00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:43.119
Okay!

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.760
You're spoiling him again.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.199
It's just one dog. What's the harm?

00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:47.540
Think of it as keeping him company.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.280
I'm getting a puppy!

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.159
Yes!

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.679
I'm so happy!

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.320
Mom!

00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:49.639
Tuanzi,

00:43:51.639 --> 00:43:52.800
don't worry.

00:43:54.559 --> 00:43:56.079
I promise

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.079
I'll give you a home.

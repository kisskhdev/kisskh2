00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.240
{\an8}From now on,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.240
{\an8}you and I are no longer friends.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.080
{\an8}Please speak to me like usual.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.360
{\an8}Call me Thee.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.720
{\an8}Please don't act like we have
never been friends like this.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.240
{\an8}I know you're that muay fighter.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600
{\an8}- It wasn't me, sir--
- Chew on that.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.160
{\an8}Why do you treat
a commoner's son like me so well?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.160
{\an8}I don't get to choose when and with whom
I will have good feelings.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.920
{\an8}I just did. With you.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.280
Father.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.240
Teaching French to Siamese officials isn't
as difficult as I expected it would be.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.240
I teach them simply,
the way Mother Rung taught me.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.840
The hardest part is the people.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.840
Because of the previous conflict
between France and Siam,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.680
many Siamese are still very angry with
and prejudiced against France.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.520
I hope that staying here this time
to teach the language

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.560
will show the Siamese people
the sincerity of France.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.480
Don't worry. I'm fine,
and I'll do my best.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.240
How is Belle? Please give her my regards.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.280
When it's been a year,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.960
her big brother will return to France
to play with her again.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640
With all my love, Rati.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.440
Please don't tell anyone, Mother,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.600
what I am actually going through.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.840
I can do it.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.120
As your son, I can do it.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.720
Please get in the car.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.760
I'll give you a ride.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.560
- Kui. Jam.
- Yes, sir?

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.479
I'm here, sir.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.920
What business do you have
with Mr. Rati, my lord?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.280
Mr. Rati has to go to work.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.680
You should go back for now, sir.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.920
Kui. Jam.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.880
I don't need a ride.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.640
The school is nearby.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.400
I am perfectly capable of walking.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.880
You haven't forgiven me then.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.720
I know you're unhappy with me,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.360
but I must ask that you separate
personal feelings from duty.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.640
I'm responsible for making your stay here
in Siam as comfortable as possible.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.520
I represent Siam,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.440
and you, France.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.160
When Siam holds out
a friendly hand to France,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.480
is it appropriate to refuse it?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.720
Watch out!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.680
Was that a prank?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.240
No.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.720
I simply wanted you to be careful.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.360
Thanks.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.440
Would you like breakfast?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.800
Thanks…

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.720
For not intruding.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.520
Are you smiling?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.240
Hurry up before we're late.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.720
You were smiling, weren't you?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.160
You're no longer mad at me.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.920
You're only teasing me, aren't you?

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.960
Whatever you say, sir.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.440
Please, hold on.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.840
I will walk in alone.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.840
I don't want people to say

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.240
that the Deputy Minister of
the Ministry of Education is favoring me.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.720
Mr. Rati.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.960
That's "Professor" to you.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.560
Within these school grounds,
I am your teacher, sir.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.200
We're only one step inside.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.200
Even so,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.240
one step has changed our status.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.640
Well then,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.960
am I allowed to call you Mr. Rati now?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.560
There, you are no longer my student,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.720
which means I can ignore you, sir.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.200
Oh?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.440
Wasn't that the servant boy?

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.480
Was it Rati?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.200
Did he come here with you, sir?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.920
Yes.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.520
I picked him up from his residence.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.320
Why would…?

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.520
Oh, I see.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.400
It is your responsibility. I understand.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.360
But it seems you take particularly
good care of our nation's guest, sir.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.880
Hello, Professor.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.480
Oh. Hello, sir.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.080
Hello.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.080
Where is your father?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.000
You're in trouble, Mek.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.760
- He's the son of a nobleman.
- Father is outside.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.280
He will be along shortly, I believe.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.480
- Watch it!
- Mhay?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.840
You scared me, Mek!

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.240
I'm sorry. I have to go!

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.960
- Hang on.
- What?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.040
Where are you off to?

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.000
I wanted to ask
if you saw my master arrive.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.360
I don't have time for that right now.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.680
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What now?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.480
Answer my question first.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.800
I can't!

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.640
If anyone asks for me,
tell them you never saw me!

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720
Never…?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.880
What?

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.320
What's his problem?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.200
Who were you talking to?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.480
No one, sir. I wasn't talking to anyone.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.559
Do you know a commoner by the name Mek?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.480
He works here.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.520
Mek?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.640
Do you know him?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.280
Of course I do, sir.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.480
I recommended him for the job.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.320
He told me to say no
if anyone asked if I had seen him.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.280
So you really were talking to him.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.880
Oh. Well…

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.520
I was, sir.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.440
Mek.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.600
What?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.880
Where are you going?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.760
Sir.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.560
Don't "sir" me.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.000
I want to talk to you,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.000
muay fighter.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.040
Muay fighter?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.640
Muay fighter who? I don't know
who you're talking about, sir.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.040
Don't pretend.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.520
What are you talking about, sir?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.760
I have to get back to work.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.480
That smell…

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.800
Muay fighters often chew on cloves
to relieve pain.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.880
You are no exception, are you?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.480
A tight-lipped culprit too.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.120
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else, sir.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.760
Excuse me.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.080
I want a rematch.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.520
Dech.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.360
Hey, servant.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080
What are you doing?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.040
Nothing, my lord.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.240
Liar.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.240
I'm telling the truth.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.360
The Baronet must have misunderstood--

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.960
It was nothing, Father.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.280
I mistook him for someone else.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.680
Get back to work.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.480
Go!

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.240
Yes, sir.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.960
The lesson will begin soon.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.080
Shall we go?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.120
Yes.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.960
Come on.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.880
Hello, Professor.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.440
Hello, Professor.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.360
How can I help?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.000
Thanks…

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.040
For not intruding.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.800
Have a good class, sir.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.680
I'll make sure to pay attention.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.360
Je suis professeur de français.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.760
"I am a French professor."

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.280
Tu es professeur de français.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.720
"You are a French professor."

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.400
Il est professeur de français.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.280
"He is a French professor."

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.120
Take the word for your occupation
and add it to this sentence.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.200
Does anyone have any questions
regarding occupations?

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.920
How do you say "student"?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.520
Étudiant.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.640
Je suis étudiant.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.120
How do you say "customs officer"?

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.280
Douanier.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.760
Now how do you introduce yourself?

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.000
Je su… is…

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.240
"Douanini."

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.040
What about "slaves"?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.000
How do you say it?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.880
"I'm a slave."

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.560
How do you say that in French, Professor?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.840
Esclave.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.840
Je suis esclave.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.280
What about…

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.640
"My mother is a slave."

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.120
"My whole family is."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.640
How would you say that
in French, Professor?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.840
My lord.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.440
I don't see how this is relevant.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.720
How is it not?

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.760
I use this word quite often.
I need to memorize it.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.320
Keep in mind
who you sit in this room with.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.200
The professor has given permission for us
to ask any questions we wish to.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.320
Am I right, my lord?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.200
Am I right, Your Highness?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.560
Ma mère est esclave.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.480
Je suis issu d'une famille d'esclaves.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.240
Repeat after me.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.080
My lord.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.760
Me?

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.280
Repeat after me.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.920
"Ma mère est esclave."

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.200
"Je suis issu d'une famille d'esclaves."

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.760
Incorrect.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.360
Ma mère est esclave.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.600
Je suis issu d'une famille d'esclaves.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680
"Ma mère est esclave."

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.080
"Je suis duidui desclaves."

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.320
Incorrect, sir.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.840
Say it once more.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.680
Enough!

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.040
But you said you use this word
quite often, my lord.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.560
You must memorize it and say it correctly.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.440
Am I right, Your Highness?

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760
I agree.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.800
Say it again.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.000
You need to have it memorized.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.440
"Ma mère… est esclave."

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.160
"Je suis… du famille desclaves?"

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.400
That's not right, sir.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.400
Ma mère est esclave.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.200
"Ma mère est esclave."

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.360
Je suis issu…

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.280
"Je suis suissu…"

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.120
…d'une famille d'esclaves.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.160
"…dune desclaves."

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.760
That is incorrect.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.560
"Ma-Ma mère est une esclave."

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.280
Say it again.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.560
"Ma mère esclave."

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.520
"Je suis issu… d'une esclave."

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.440
You must be exhausted.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.680
Your Highness.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.440
Your Royal Highness.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.400
My compliments.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.080
You dealt with the situation
quite cleverly.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.000
You are a young man,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.720
yet you are so mature.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.920
His Majesty was right to praise you
and ask you to teach the language here.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.600
You flattered me…

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.520
I mean, you praise me too much,
Your Highness.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.920
Is it difficult?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.200
It is indeed.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.040
Speak simply.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.800
You are a foreigner. I'll allow it.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.240
If you use the wrong words,
I might find it harder to understand.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.920
I thought I'd had enough practice.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.560
Think of me as a friend.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.440
Speak to me the way you'd speak
to a friend, Professor.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.280
I fear it wouldn't be proper.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.000
How so?

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.920
Try it.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.000
Take it as my request.
Will that be all right, Professor?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.960
Of course,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.280
dear Mai.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.840
See?

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.320
I told you it wouldn't be proper.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.280
No one has ever called me that before.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.640
"Dear Mai" it is.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.160
I'll let you call me that.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.400
Are you…

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.520
on your way back home, Professor?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.720
I will walk with you.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.960
I have questions about the lesson too.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.800
What are they talking about?

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.320
This is where you stay, Rati?

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.280
The Deputy Minister arranged it for me.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.600
The place is not
completely sorted, however.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.280
It's still quite messy inside.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.120
Do you need my help?

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.920
I couldn't possibly.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.120
I enjoy arranging furniture,
and I still have belongings to deal with.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.240
My lord?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.960
I'm getting curious about you, sir.
You're here day and night.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.440
You're here at any hour of the day, sir.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.760
I did not mean to follow you,
Your Highness.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.360
But it is my duty to oversee
the French professor's stay here.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.080
I did not want to invade your privacy,
so I trailed behind from afar.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.040
You've taken this task upon yourself?

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.040
I understand you have a number
of employees under your supervision.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.800
It is no imposition.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.840
Thanks for the clarification
on the lesson.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.200
I will surely revise it.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.160
As for the classes,

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.800
do not fret, Rati.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.000
Just as you have to adjust
to your students,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.360
we students must adjust to you.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.280
Everything will be fine.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.400
Thanks, dear Mai.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.680
Did I mishear?

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.720
Are you and the prince close enough
to be on a first-name basis?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.760
Ask Kui to brew you some ginger tea
to relieve your hard day's work, sir.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.920
I only followed you
so I could tell you that.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.040
Don't forget it, Mr. Rati!

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.760
Are you talking to yourself, sir?

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.080
I'm not your friend.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.280
How was your day, sir?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.160
I'm so tired, Kui.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.240
Good thing there is no class tomorrow.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.640
I'll make sure to sleep in.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.880
Don't take a nap now, sir.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.240
I'll fetch you some cold water.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.920
Kui.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.400
Yes, sir?

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.360
Nothing.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.760
I'll come back with a cold drink.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.560
Kui.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.480
Yes?

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.760
Nothing.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.920
You called me and said "nothing" twice.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.360
Do let me know what you want, sir.
It will be my pleasure to do it.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.720
It will?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.720
Yes.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.200
Well, if you insist, Kui.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.240
So, what do you want, sir?

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.680
Ginger tea.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.160
Ginger tea.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.720
Someone said that
ginger tea helps relieve stress.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800
Of course, sir.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.680
A certain lord said ginger tea
helps relieve stress.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.320
Kui!

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.800
Yes?

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.000
Mek is here, big bro.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.120
Sir?

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.360
I told you I wanted a rematch.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.360
Let's not, sir.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.280
Scared?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.800
If you can beat me,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.240
you take it.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.960
That is 50 baht.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.800
- Whoa! 50 baht!
- Whoa! 50 baht!

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.320
That's a lot of money, Mek.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.280
Take it!

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.800
If that's your wish, sir.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.760
Fight!

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.240
- Go for it, Mek!
- You got it!

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.680
- Go for it!
- You can do it, Mek!

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.720
- Do your best!
- Get him, Mek!

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.880
- Beat him!
- Do it, Mek!

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.440
Go for it, Mek!

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.920
Hit him!

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.920
Mek!

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.480
You got it, Mek.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.840
If you don't stop holding back,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.680
I'll have my father
get you fired from work.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.600
Sir.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.640
Get serious or lose your job.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.560
Take your pick.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.960
Mek, just get serious and beat him!

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.160
- Go for it!
- You got it, Mek!

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.600
- Go for it, Mek!
- Beat him!

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.480
Bring it!

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.480
Mek wins!

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.320
- Mek is the winner!
- Sir?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.600
Are you all right, sir?

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.640
Stars…

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.520
I see stars.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.800
Now this is serious.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.720
Ow!

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800
Does it hurt?

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.240
Ko.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.480
Go grab my pouch of cloves.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.440
Yes.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.600
Here, sir.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.080
Cloves.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.960
They work.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.480
Take them and chew on them.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.280
One baht, sir.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.400
You make a lot of money fighting.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.000
What do you need all this money for?

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.160
It is better
to have a lot of it on hand, sir.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.080
I'm not paying.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.080
Hold on.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.240
For you, sir.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.280
Cloves?

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.760
It won't help.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.640
I have a feeling that punch
might have broken my jaw.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.800
It feels like that at first.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.080
You will get used to it after a while.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.240
Why do you fight?

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.480
Why not find some work
where you don't have to get hurt?

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.160
I could ask you the same thing, sir.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.360
You have a title and money.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.440
Why do you fight?

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.640
Because I have everything,

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.160
so I want what I don't have.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.880
It is completely different from me, sir.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.360
I don't have anything,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.880
so I must work for everything.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.520
Whatever pays,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.200
I'll do it.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.360
Poverty doesn't care
whether I like something or not.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.280
There is only necessity.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.400
A poor man like me doesn't get to choose.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.600
But you get a chance to choose

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.520
what to study

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.320
and how to live,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.560
so you should choose well, sir.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.880
A poor man like me doesn't get to choose.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.120
You can choose what to do,

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880
what to study,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.560
and how to live.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.320
You should choose well, sir.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.720
What business do you have, sir?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.720
My master has brought some food.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.680
Is your master home?

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.400
Mr. Rati is upstairs.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.640
Kui!

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.000
This is the nobleman
who is allegedly "that way" inclined.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.720
Do you think we should
let him see Mr. Rati?

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.160
Please, sir.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.880
No, sir!

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.160
Mr. Rati insisted that nobody
should disturb him today.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.200
Who did he mean by "nobody"?

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.320
Did he specifically name my master?

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.640
If not, then who did he mean?

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320
Yeah.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.160
Who?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.880
Kui.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.200
We are not letting him in!

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.400
Kui. Jam. Look.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.800
My master was kind enough to bring
all this food for your master.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.800
Of course,
there is enough for you two as well.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.280
Wouldn't you like to have a taste?

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.600
Don't you want your master
to enjoy this delicacy?

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.480
Let me see.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.440
By all means.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.960
- Wow!
- Scream.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.400
Scream with joy.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.560
- Let me help.
- No.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.120
- No, sir!
- Please!

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.040
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE-DAME

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.960
Unrequited love is quite a tragedy,
don't you think?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.920
Between Quasimodo and Esmeralda…

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.400
Whose fate do you think is more tragic?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.320
You probably think…

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
it's Quasimodo's.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.800
Esmeralda's, actually.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.160
Why?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.680
Because Esmeralda
doesn't do anything wrong.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960
She only refuses to bow down to injustice

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.880
and fights to the death for what is right.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.720
Her density has always been
in someone else's hands.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.000
I, however, sympathize with Quasimodo.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.280
Don't you?

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.440
A man crushed
under the weight of deformity

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.760
who could only hide
in the shadow of the cathedral.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.120
I doubt someone like you understands
how Quasimodo feels, sir.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.920
You were born into a noble family.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.760
You are wealthy and well-educated.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.320
How could someone like you

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.520
understand a hunchback
hiding in the corner of a cathedral?

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.200
Maybe I have hidden something.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.520
Something the world

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.280
doesn't accept.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.960
If you want to help me tidy up the place,
I won't stop you.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.600
But please don't distract me from my task.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.040
Where are you going, sir?

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.520
I'm going to clean the bedroom.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.920
- No.
- But--

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.120
It's my bedroom.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.520
I'll clean it myself.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.000
And I haven't forgiven you, sir.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.640
I'll clean another room.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.800
When you finally forgive me,
I'll clean your bedroom.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.840
Let me help.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.920
No need.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.760
Allow me.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.200
Stay still.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.360
I'll get it.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.760
Does it feel better?

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.440
Won't you thank me at all?

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.200
Is cordiality such a rare quality
among the French?

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.320
Thank you!

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.080
It's really good, Mhay!

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.160
- Told you!
- Right?

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.600
You should have brought more.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.760
Kui!

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.360
You disgusting pig. Take the whole thing!

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.920
I'm so full, but the food is too good!

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.720
Just stop eating. I'll take it.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.000
Careful, you two!

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.360
Kui! Jam!

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.520
Mr. Rati.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.360
Ow!

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.960
You said your master had left!

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.000
I thought he had!

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.560
Master, you're still here?

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.880
Is the dessert good?

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.159
Very much so, sir.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.440
Shut your mouth.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.679
You enticed my attendants with dessert?

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.480
You fox.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.080
Enticed them?

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.320
I was merely being generous.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.639
I brought some for you as well.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.880
You like desserts.
I hope you will enjoy this.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.719
Jam.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800
What's that sound?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.520
A bicycle, sir.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.840
It's a small vehicle
with two wheels and pedals.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.040
We don't have one, do we?

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.240
No, sir.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.920
It might be nice to have one,
don't you think?

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.080
Definitely, sir!

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.400
- Ding!
- Hey.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.640
Bicycles?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.960
Bicycles.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.120
I bet it would be fun to ride one.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.840
A bicycle?

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.640
How lucky I am!

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.000
Where did you get it?

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.480
They're not difficult to find.
Would you like to ride it?

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.680
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.400
What do you say, Mr. Rati?

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.360
No.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.360
Are you sure?

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.560
Well,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.560
I'm off then.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.480
Mr. Rati.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.880
He's back, sir!

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.800
I'll ask you once more.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.040
Would you like to ride it?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.200
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.840
What does it matter what I would like?

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.720
It's not as if you're going
to give it to me, sir.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.280
I was going to.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.680
So he was!

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.520
Did you think
I'd forgive you if you did this?

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.280
I am a happy man just talking to you.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.240
Forgive him for what?

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.160
How would I know?

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.200
I'm giving it to you
for a practical reason.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.200
If you want a riding buddy,

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.320
I'll wait for you at the lotus pond
behind the temple this evening.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520
Bicycle!

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.400
How does this work?

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.280
To what do I owe the pleasure, my lord?

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.720
I am here about Mr. Rati.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.520
Is the servant boy so important that you
must travel all this way to discuss him?

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.000
Mr. Rati is a Frenchman
and the guest of our nation.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.800
By the Ministry of Education's order,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.320
I have been tasked with the job
of taking care of him.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.600
In our previous lessons,

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.200
your behavior has been nothing short
of disrespectful to our guest.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.520
Will you, from now on, respect Mr. Rati,

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.800
as any gentleman should?

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.120
You see,

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.480
before you ask me that question,

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.840
why don't you go take a look
at where he came from?

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.440
I don't see how his past is relevant.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.200
You are asking me,

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.960
Mom Rajawong Rujrapeepat Suriyakorn,

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.160
to bow down to a servant boy.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.520
Isn't that even less acceptable?

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.720
If you refuse to comply,

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.520
I will have no choice
but to report this to the ministry

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.640
and have you withdrawn
from the student list.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.120
You think I want to be in that class?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.000
So you wish to withdraw?

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.200
If it wasn't an official order,

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.600
I would never have shown my face there.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.000
You don't want to study,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.640
but you must for your job.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.480
If that is the case,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.280
I do hope you will cease
hindering Mr. Rati from doing his job

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.360
as you have been doing.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.760
Do you understand, sir?

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.640
I don't hear a "no,"

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.600
so I will take it that you do.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.920
That was all I'm here for.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.880
Good day.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.000
What on earth
are you standing there for? Huh?

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.480
Were you spying on me
so you could spread the word?

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.400
You're satisfied, aren't you,
that I have to be tutored by a servant?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.840
Are you satisfied now?

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.720
No! No, sir.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.200
How dare you?!

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.920
Hey.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.680
Hey, you missed a spot.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.840
I am getting to it!
Would you rather you do it yourself?

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920
You're too slow!

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.160
Do it yourself, why don't you?

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.400
No. You do it.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.800
- Why should I?
- Kui. Jam.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.640
I'm going to the market.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.320
You are?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.840
You should take the bicycle, sir.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.400
No.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.680
I'd rather walk.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.440
Mr. Rati.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.680
Mr. Rati, sir!

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.200
- Mr. Rati.
- Mhay?

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.720
How dare you just barge in here?

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.080
I can have an officer
arrest you for trespassing.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.840
There's an emergency, sir.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.280
What's the matter?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.040
- My master was hit on the head.
- What?

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.640
Who would dare?

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.960
It was Lord Ruj.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.560
Mr. Thee.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.520
Mr. Thee.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480
Mr. Thee.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.800
Mr. Thee.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Mr. Thee.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.720
It's you?

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.840
Mr. Thee.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.960
Mr. Thee, why aren't you at the hospital?

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.240
I'm quite fine.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.280
That's not for you to decide.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.720
You should see a doctor.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.120
Come with me this instant.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200
Are you worried about me?

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.400
Mr. Thee.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.840
You rode the bicycle and stopped
calling me "sir" at every turn.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.960
You forgave me, didn't you?

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.920
I never meant to hide anything from you.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.720
But I will admit that

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.720
I did not tell you the truth
when it was called for.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.480
It was my cowardice.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.800
I was afraid that you,
upon knowing who I am,

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.080
would put a distance between us
and think you should humble yourself,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.680
the way you do with everyone.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.520
I simply want you to be my friend.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.720
Someone who stays by my side.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.480
You don't believe me?

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.760
Go to the hospital.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.520
No.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.120
Go to the hospital first,

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.760
and then I'll give you a second chance.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.280
Do you mean it?

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.600
Go to the hospital!

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.800
Will you be my friend again right away?

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.400
We can go to the hospital together.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.480
Mr. Thee.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.960
Please.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.840
If we postpone going to the hospital any
longer, my wound could get infected.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.840
Just go, Mr. Thee.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.600
Can you stop calling me "mister"?

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.080
What friends address each other
with such cold indifference?

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.400
You call Prince Mai by his name.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.120
He asked me to.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.720
And here I am, asking.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.120
You're pushing your luck.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.240
Please.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.160
Dear Thee.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.120
What now?

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:13.960
That doesn't sound right.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.680
I can't possibly try
to measure up to His Highness.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.520
What do you want me to call you then?

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.000
Call me…

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.280
by my name.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.120
Thee.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.440
Please.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.840
Simply Thee.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.040
Thee.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.560
Pardon?

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.480
Thee.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.760
Thee!

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.320
I heard you.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.000
If I died of infection right now,

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.000
I'd die a happy man.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.600
Rati.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.600
Thee!

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.200
{\an8}If you want me to teach you French, you
must teach me muay, Monsieur Mek.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.120
{\an8}I will make sure my lessons
match your kindness.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.480
{\an8}NEXT EPISODE

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.800
{\an8}I suddenly felt like I was burning inside
despite being in the water.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.440
{\an8}Like if I did not hold on to something,

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.280
{\an8}I might have floated away.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.160
{\an8}People might think I was
trying to seduce you.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.960
{\an8}Would you still say you were not
disgusted by me?

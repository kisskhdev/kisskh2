WEBVTT

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.440
Opening the back!

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:25.359
This one's critical.

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:27.695
Patient is male, thirties,
with multiple injuries.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:28.779
- What level?
- 300.

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:30.614
- How are his vitals?
- Unobtainable.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:31.532
Hurry!

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.492
One, two, three.

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:35.703
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.123
MVA-induced multiple trauma
with intra-abdominal bleeding.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.750
Level of consciousness, 300.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.419
No measurable pulse or blood pressure.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.129
- Prepare for intubation.
- Okay.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.558
Why?

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:01.687
How could this happen to my Tomo?

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:05.232
That woman...

00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:10.780
That wife of his is the
one who should've died!

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:15.284
Excuse me.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.871
May I speak with you for a moment?

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.503
Apparently, he's unconscious
and in critical condition.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:30.382
The last person Tomoya Hirano spoke
with on the phone was Misa Kanbe.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.927
That is you, correct?

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:34.720
Yes.

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:39.183
You and Mr. Hirano were coworkers
and were once engaged. Is that correct?

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.269
Yes.

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:45.564
What is your relationship
with Mr. Hirano's wife, Reina?

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.276
We were childhood friends
and best friends.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.988
She is a victim.
You'll understand if you look into it.

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:56.867
I've heard from the Toyama Police.

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:00.955
We're trying to locate her
in connection with this case.

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:04.333
Do you have any idea where she might be?

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.752
I'm not sure.

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:09.713
At a lover's place?
Or maybe with a friend?

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.507
Reina doesn't really...

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.178
have any friends other than me.

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:18.889
Please let us help with the investigation.

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:21.892
We need to catch her as soon as possible.

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.561
There's no telling what she might do.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.667
Thank you.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.228
Nabeyaki udon?

00:03:06.896 --> 00:03:08.063
It'll warm you up.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.941
Is this your specialty?

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.195
My mother often made it for me
when I was a child.

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:18.616
Whenever I caught a cold
or wasn't feeling well.

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.621
It's got all the nutrients you need.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.208
Thank you for the food.

00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:43.057
How is it?

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:47.853
It has a gentle taste. It's comforting.

00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:57.529
Director,

00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:02.743
you were always there watching over me.

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:07.331
You were always protecting me.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.252
Even when I was treated like a stalker.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.172
Sorry. I apologize for that.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.550
Not at all. I was joking.

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.892
Let's eat before it gets cold.

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:30.229
Okay.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.497
I'm sorry, but...

00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:50.749
when I was looking for you,

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.419
<i>I accidentally looked at the calendar</i>
<i>on your computer.</i>

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:55.170
MAMEKAME-DOU OWNER
PASSES AWAY

00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:59.466
The owner of Mamekame-dou
will pass away soon, right?

00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:01.844
Yes.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.303
Is there anything...

00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:05.264
I don't think there's anything we can do.

00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:08.600
Right...

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:10.477
I'm sure...

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.440
he had a good life.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.068
A good life...

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:27.995
I have to...

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.249
settle things with Reina.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.669
Leave that to me.

00:05:35.753 --> 00:05:36.795
No.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.174
I'm the one who drove her over the edge.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.969
This all started between me and Reina.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.766
I don't want to run away from her anymore.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.350
Don't do this.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.687
It's too dangerous to face her
the way she is now.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.320
"You're not the kind of person
who can become a villain."

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.908
That's what you told me, Director.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.161
But I'm thinking...

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:11.205
If Tomoya...

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:21.006
If Tomoya... ends up dying
from that car accident,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.970
your life will be spared instead.

00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:31.141
I'm hoping that's how it ends.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:36.855
I want it to happen that way.

00:06:38.774 --> 00:06:40.484
That's what I'm thinking now.

00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:45.656
I'm more than bad enough to be a villain.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.250
I understand how you feel.

00:06:57.543 --> 00:07:01.463
Even so, I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.052
Because in my second life...

00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:10.097
I need you too.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.784
Wataru, you are leaving the head office.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.079
As director of Suzutoya's
restaurant operations--

00:07:34.163 --> 00:07:37.416
I'm going to get the restaurant business
back into the black, right?

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:44.840
If I may, I'd like to propose a change
to how the restaurants are run.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:46.300
FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:50.304
Your anticipation is noted and unwelcome.

00:07:51.597 --> 00:07:53.182
Show it to me at the next meeting.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.937
Good grief, he's got
the patience of a housefly.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.569
Sorry, as always.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.279
It's fine.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.534
Did you know you would be
put in charge of the restaurant division?

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.913
Yes... I had a hunch.

00:08:17.623 --> 00:08:19.291
Impressive.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:24.254
The media's having a field day with that
accident involving one of our employees.

00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.715
Please leave that matter to me.

SUZUTOYA EMPLOYEE IN CRITICAL CONDITION
MASSIVE DEBT AND MISSING WIFE A MYSTERY

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:44.107
Director.

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:46.944
You have a call from Asahi.
It's the CEO's secretary.

00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:49.947
Asahi Department Store?

00:08:56.078 --> 00:09:00.249
Hello, this is Suzuki, director of
Corporate Strategy at Suzutoya Holdings.

00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:02.876
<i>This is Sato from Asahi Department Store.</i>

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:05.170
It's a pleasure to speak with you.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.632
<i>The pleasure's all mine.</i>
<i>I'm calling on behalf of our CEO.</i>

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:13.220
<i>We sincerely apologize for unnecessarily</i>
<i>escalating the allergy incident.</i>

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.932
No, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience
that we caused you.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.893
<i>The years have made</i>
<i>him stubborn and prone to anger.</i>

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:22.354
No, we take full responsibility for--

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.443
Reina Esaka?

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:31.029
<i>You finally noticed.</i>

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.369
But I got married, you know?

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.538
Because of what you two did.

00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:43.667
<i>So now, I'm Reina Hirano.</i>

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:48.672
Did you tamper with the brakes
on Tomoya Hirano's car?

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:51.300
It was a kill or be killed kind of thing.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.176
More importantly,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.638
my best friend didn't come to work today.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.642
She doesn't seem to be
in her new apartment either.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.355
I wonder if she's on vacation
at a luxury hotel.

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:08.942
<i>Must be nice to have</i>
<i>such a rich boyfriend.</i>

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:12.321
I'll hang up if you're just
going to waste my time.

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.823
<i>I have a meeting to attend.</i>
<i>Thank you for your call.</i>

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.408
Wait.

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.577
<i>Let me see Misa.</i>

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:21.997
If I'm going to get arrested anyway,

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.833
I want to see Misa before I go.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:29.338
<i>Just give me a little time to talk to her.</i>
<i>I won't do anything.</i>

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:32.632
And why should I believe
a word you're saying?

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.969
Please. Just a little bit.
Just five minutes is enough.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:40.891
If you let me see Misa now,
I'll never bother you again.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.518
Hard sell coming from a liar...

00:10:43.602 --> 00:10:45.103
<i>This is my last chance.</i>

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:47.939
I can't let this end
with Misa hating me. Please.

00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:53.737
Once I meet Misa, I'll turn myself in.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:55.614
<i>I promise.</i>

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:02.412
I'll be waiting tomorrow at 2 p.m.
at the Seventeen Hotel lounge.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:31.566
Director?

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:36.321
What are you thinking about?

00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:38.031
It's nothing.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.662
Tomorrow is the funeral
for the owner of Mamekame-dou, right?

00:11:45.247 --> 00:11:46.206
Yes.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.376
I'd like to pay my respects one last time.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:57.175
Actually, something suddenly came up
at work, so I don't think I'll make it.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.677
Oh, really?

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.222
I'd be worried
if you went out on your own,

00:12:02.973 --> 00:12:04.641
so please take my sister with you.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:06.643
Okay.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.040
FUNERAL
FOR SOICHI KAMEYAMA

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:33.837
The venue is that way.

00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:38.633
Please take this exchange ticket.
The venue is that way.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.138
Thank you.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:47.267
Thank you for being a part of his life.
The venue is that way.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.520
RECEPTION

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.936
Please have a seat.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.317
Excuse me.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.057
That was a really heartfelt ceremony.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.350
Yeah, it was.

00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.895
I'll have them bring the car around.

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:14.813
Okay.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:21.695
Ms. Kanbe.

00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:27.993
Long time no see.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.838
Has anything changed on your end?

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:45.468
No, Reina Hirano is nowhere to be seen.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.429
If we see anything, I'll let you know.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.975
Chief.

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:04.988
Wataru?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.992
You can't reach Ms. Kanbe?

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:12.287
Everything's fine. It's over,
so we're on our way out.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.331
But it may take a bit more time.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.249
Apparently, there's some handover issue.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:17.709
Handover?

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:21.838
<i>Yes, he said there was something</i>
<i>he forgot to tell Ms. Sumiyoshi.</i>

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.966
<i>Something important</i>
<i>involving our business partners.</i>

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.509
Talk about what? With who?

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:31.097
We got a clear image of the man
who broke into the garage

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:35.810
<i>and tampered with Tomoya Hirano's brakes.</i>
<i>It was caught on a nearby security camera.</i>

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:44.611
Section Chief Tomita.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:46.571
Tomita?

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:52.202
I caused you a lot of trouble while I was
in the second planning department.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:56.164
I really regret
being such a terrible boss.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.165
Not at all.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.462
<i>Apparently, when he was</i>
<i>in the wagashi department,</i>

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:05.006
<i>the owner of Mamekame-dou helped him out.</i>

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.510
<i>We ran into him at the funeral.</i>

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.179
<i>He's talking with Ms. Kanbe</i>
<i>about work now.</i>

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.808
Tomita was never
in the wagashi department.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.476
Huh?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:26.653
Excuse me! Ms. Kanbe!

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.238
Miku, where are you right now?

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.658
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
That was totally my fault.

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:33.243
Please excuse me.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.289
You liar.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.835
I knew you wouldn't bring Misa.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:47.173
And to make matters worse,
the place is crawling with cops.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.468
What did you do to Ms. Kanbe?

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.387
Is this what you want?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.182
If you turn me in now,
you'll never see Misa again.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:00.228
Come with me.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.246
I'm going to the restroom.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:41.019
I feel bad for how I treated
Ms. Sumiyoshi too.

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:45.607
I think her illness may have actually been
caused by all the stress I put on her.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:50.570
So, how much further is it to the cafe?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.240
Come on now, there's no need to rush.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.951
I was your boss,
but we were still on the same team,

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.954
so let's take some time
to talk about life or whatever.

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.751
I guess you're not interested

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.711
in what happened to a man...

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.673
who lost everything he had going for him,
thanks to your schemes.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:14.010
When I got sent to the warehouse,

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:17.305
rumors that I had sexually harassed
and bullied my subordinates

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:18.848
were already spreading.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.308
I'm sure...

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.269
I have you and Suzuki
to thank for that as well, huh?

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:26.648
I had absolutely nowhere to go.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.986
At this age and in this economy,
there's no way I could find a decent job.

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:38.409
My life was over!

00:18:41.996 --> 00:18:43.414
That's when...

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.879
Long time no see.

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:53.675
Ms. Esaka.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.805
<i>She appeared... My angel...</i>

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:04.060
Reina forgave me for everything
even though I betrayed her.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.104
She said in a gentle voice,

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:09.065
"Live for me."

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.402
She gave me...

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.948
a reason to live again.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:38.970
Stop there.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:47.562
Where is Ms. Kanbe?

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.275
I just remembered...

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:56.613
our first road trip together.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.781
Where is she? Is she with Tomita?

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.162
Misa's always been such a careless girl.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.039
Where is Ms. Kanbe?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.917
If you kiss me, I'll tell you.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.090
I want to overwrite the memory
of the most unpleasant date of my life.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:17.300
You're insane.

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.722
Then you'll never see Misa alive again.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.891
Never ever.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.813
So, what's it gonna be?

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.421
Answer me, answer me!

00:20:56.714 --> 00:20:58.716
Out with it!

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.070
You're in the way, you piece of shit!

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:24.075
You're always, always getting between us!

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.710
You wanna play the hero?
Then die like one!

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:36.921
As a substitute for Misa.

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:11.914
Misa...

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.837
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.921
NO TRESPASSING

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:22.258
UNDER RENOVATION
FROM NOVEMBER 2, 2015 TO FEBRUARY 26, 2016

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:27.180 line:20%
DREAMLAND THEME PARK

00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:30.183
Misa.

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:38.066
Morning.

00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:46.866
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:52.288
Do you remember the amusement park
your dad would take us to?

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:56.042
That Ferris wheel actually got taken down,
so it's gone now.

00:22:57.668 --> 00:23:00.046
We even rode it
during our school trip, didn't we?

00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:03.174
Nobody would let you join their group,

00:23:03.257 --> 00:23:05.301
so I reached out to you, right?

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:07.887
That's right.

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.263
I have this.

00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:11.766
These really take you back, huh?

00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:13.017
I have one for you too.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:16.145
I made it. Stick out your hand.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:19.607
Do it!

00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:27.657
What happened there?

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:32.453
This?

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.790
It doesn't concern you, Misa.

00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.000
Stop getting distracted!

00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:40.962
I want to savor every moment
with my long-lost bestie.

00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:42.463
There, all done.

00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:49.303
Reina...

00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:50.888
Hm?

00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:53.224
What do you want?

00:23:56.227 --> 00:23:57.728
I wanted to talk to you.

00:23:57.812 --> 00:23:58.896
About what?

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.982
I've been doing a lot of thinking...

00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:04.360
about what I should do from here on out.

00:24:05.987 --> 00:24:11.492
But without you,
I couldn't come up with anything.

00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:17.123
But when you're here with me,
the ideas just come flooding in.

00:24:18.166 --> 00:24:19.292
For mean things to do?

00:24:19.834 --> 00:24:20.835
You're one to talk.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.547
I...

00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:32.054
have something
I've been wanting to tell you.

00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:34.765
What?

00:24:35.516 --> 00:24:36.559
I...

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.439
have always hated you, Reina.

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:49.989
Your selfishness,

00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:53.284
your pushiness, the way
you only ever bad-mouth people...

00:24:54.327 --> 00:24:57.205
the way you can hurt others
without a second thought.

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.083
I have always, always hated you.

00:25:03.294 --> 00:25:05.379
That time when we were
in the second grade,

00:25:05.463 --> 00:25:08.174
when I was crying and you held my hand,

00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:11.719
<i>your hand was so warm,</i>

00:25:12.637 --> 00:25:14.555
<i>and I was really happy.</i>

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:17.934
But...

00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:22.480
being with you always felt suffocating.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.858
Even when we were getting along,

00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:30.529
deep down... I was always wishing
I could get away from you.

00:25:37.578 --> 00:25:38.454
Yeah.

00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:42.208
I knew that.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.963
You wanting to get away from me

00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:50.216
made me never want to let you go.

00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:56.138
I could never allow you to throw me away
and find happiness on your own.

00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:02.228
We've known each other
since we were seven years old,

00:26:03.312 --> 00:26:05.731
but this is our first time
to actually share our feelings.

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:09.193
That's true.

00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:12.613
If we had just been honest,

00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:16.784
maybe it wouldn't have
turned out this way.

00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:19.662
I don't know.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.083
I've...

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:27.837
been killed by you before.

00:26:34.385 --> 00:26:35.386
What do you mean?

00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:37.430
I mean exactly what I said.

00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:42.268
You took my life once.

00:26:44.228 --> 00:26:47.648
But I don't think
it was your fault anymore.

00:26:49.191 --> 00:26:51.569
I didn't understand you.

00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:53.696
I wasn't interested in you.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.948
But even so,

00:26:57.158 --> 00:26:59.744
I stayed with you,
pretending to be your best friend.

00:27:00.286 --> 00:27:01.996
I was a liar.

00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:08.836
But now... I'm happy,

00:27:09.795 --> 00:27:12.590
because I started my life
over without lying this time.

00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:15.676
And I'm sure...

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:18.637
if you left me behind,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.890
you could live a different life.

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:25.227
An easier life.

00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:32.902
You may be right.

00:27:36.489 --> 00:27:38.032
But it's too late.

00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:46.332
Unlike you,

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:49.752
I don't get second chances at life!

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.093
I don't want to be alone.

00:27:58.302 --> 00:27:59.512
Misa, please...

00:28:01.222 --> 00:28:02.681
die with me.

00:28:27.832 --> 00:28:30.334 line:20%
START
STOP

00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:32.128
Please.

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:35.589
You're all I have, Misa!

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:38.426
Misa...

00:28:40.594 --> 00:28:42.221
let's die together.

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:46.809
Reina...

00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:52.523
I feel so bad for you.

00:28:52.606 --> 00:28:53.983
You should!

00:28:55.276 --> 00:28:56.986
Do you get it now?

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:02.950
We promised, remember?

00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:07.413
That we'd be together forever.

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.170
Let me respond honestly.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.176
No way in hell!

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:20.861
Die! Die! Die!

00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:26.927
Reina.

00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:32.600
That's enough. We're finished.

00:31:39.857 --> 00:31:44.320
Let's... go our separate ways.

00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:12.598
I'm sorry, Misa.

00:32:17.186 --> 00:32:19.229
Remember this for the rest of your life.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.710
Because it's all your fault.

00:35:19.743 --> 00:35:22.496
Director? Director!

00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:35.968
Doctor! How's my son?

00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:42.933
There was significant blood loss,
and his condition remains critical.

00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:46.436
If only someone had called an ambulance
right after the stabbing...

00:35:47.813 --> 00:35:48.981
It's regrettable.

00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:52.150
Please. Save him.

00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:54.778
The situation is very serious.

00:35:54.862 --> 00:35:56.989
Please prepare for the worst.

00:36:17.885 --> 00:36:19.052
Director...

00:36:34.902 --> 00:36:36.987
If you don't wake up...

00:36:38.322 --> 00:36:39.823
I'll be lost.

00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:46.914
Why don't we go for another walk together?

00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:54.046
Let's go to all the wagashi shops and
used clothing stores and flower stands...

00:36:55.547 --> 00:36:57.132
We'll just wander together.

00:36:59.885 --> 00:37:02.638
I want us to eat good food,

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:07.726
and see movies, and travel...

00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:13.857
So let's go... together...

00:37:17.152 --> 00:37:20.405
Your sister Miku loves you so much.

00:37:20.489 --> 00:37:22.991
You have to show her
that you're still here.

00:37:24.117 --> 00:37:26.578
And Kamekichi is waiting too...

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.005
Wataru? No! Wataru!

00:37:39.967 --> 00:37:41.718
Please come back!

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:45.597
Please...

00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:48.141
Wataru, please...

00:37:56.108 --> 00:37:57.275
<i>Wataru.</i>

00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:03.198
Wataru.

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.876
My, how you've grown.

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:36.565
But you're still the same inside.

00:38:45.115 --> 00:38:46.241
I'm sorry.

00:38:49.703 --> 00:38:51.413
I've burdened you...

00:38:53.373 --> 00:38:55.584
with so much responsibility.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.546
From now on, live for yourself.

00:39:00.756 --> 00:39:02.340
Your happiness is...

00:39:03.633 --> 00:39:05.552
my happiness.

00:39:15.896 --> 00:39:17.147
Now, off you go.

00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:27.866
The one you love is waiting.

00:39:38.794 --> 00:39:43.215
Time of death confirmed at 11:10 p.m.,
January 16, 2016.

00:39:50.472 --> 00:39:52.182
Tomo... Tomo!

00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:54.309
- Tomo!
- Tomoya!

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.311
- Tomo!
- Tomoya!

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:58.480
- Tomo!
- Tomoya!

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:32.973
Mr. Suzuki. You're in the hospital.

00:40:33.682 --> 00:40:36.768
The surgery is over.
You can rest easy now.

00:40:38.186 --> 00:40:39.271
Wataru,

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.815
can you hear me?

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:01.168
Welcome back.

00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:15.533
Reina.

00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:18.912
It's spring...

00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:22.499
the season we first met.

00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:46.815
I'm sorry, Reina.

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.443
Goodbye.

00:43:07.043 --> 00:43:07.877
Director!

00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:13.466
Uber Eats has arrived.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.260
Uber Eats, what's that?

00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:18.722
Please stop using words
people haven't heard of yet.

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:20.932
What did you bring me today?

00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:30.692
Here.

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:31.609
Thank you.

00:43:39.451 --> 00:43:41.286
Here, three o'clock snacks.

00:43:42.329 --> 00:43:43.788
Thank you very much.

00:43:56.843 --> 00:43:57.802
Let's eat.

00:43:57.886 --> 00:43:58.720
Sure.

00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:06.561
It's good.

00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:11.107
Oh, that is good!

00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:14.444
But...

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:20.200
it just makes me really want to have
Mamekame-dou's turtle monaka again.

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:25.038
We'll always have it in our memories.

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:41.388
Is rehab going well?

00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:43.473
Yes, do you want to see?

00:44:43.556 --> 00:44:46.184
- Huh? Are you able to walk now?
- I can even run.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:47.936
No way!

00:44:56.403 --> 00:45:00.323
Anyone with a spare hand,
please help line up the food.

00:45:00.407 --> 00:45:01.574
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:45:01.658 --> 00:45:02.784
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:10.542
He's here!

00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:11.793
Okay, everyone!

00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:13.294
All together!

00:45:13.378 --> 00:45:17.340
Director Suzuki, congratulations
on your recovery!

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.762
Do you want to say a few words?

00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:28.977
I wasn't expecting
so many of you to be here...

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.146
Thank you all for taking the time.

00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:34.441
You're so serious! What a boring speech.

00:45:34.524 --> 00:45:35.859
Congratulations.

00:45:35.942 --> 00:45:40.488
We've put a lot of love into today's
dishes, so please eat as much as you want.

00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:42.407
- Thank you.
- This way.

00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:46.536
- Everyone! She's here!
- She's here!

00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:47.912
All together!

00:45:47.996 --> 00:45:53.001
Section Chief Sumiyoshi,
congratulations on your recovery!

00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:55.753
Wow! What a surprise!

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:57.881
I thought this was just a dinner party!

00:45:57.964 --> 00:46:02.969
Today, we're celebrating both you and
the director getting out of the hospital.

00:46:03.052 --> 00:46:04.053
You should have told me!

00:46:04.137 --> 00:46:06.931
I'm still recovering,
you nearly gave me a heart attack.

00:46:07.724 --> 00:46:10.268
So... how are you feeling?

00:46:10.894 --> 00:46:12.770
Yeah. As you can see...

00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:14.856
Maybe even better than before.

00:46:15.732 --> 00:46:17.859
I'm going back to work next week,

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:20.111
so you'll be stuck with me
for a while yet.

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.618
Okay, okay.

00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:29.245
- You're always so dramatic!
- I'm sorry.

00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:34.751
Please take a seat.

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:35.793
Please.

00:46:35.877 --> 00:46:36.753
Thanks.

00:46:37.754 --> 00:46:40.215
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:47.805
So, what happened with your husband?

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.601
Since he learned about my illness,

00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:54.020
my husband has been on his best behavior.

00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:56.356
It seems he ended things
with that part-timer.

00:46:56.856 --> 00:46:59.859
While I was in the hospital, he did all
of the housework and took care of Riko.

00:46:59.943 --> 00:47:02.403
Thanks to that,
I was able to make a full recovery.

00:47:02.487 --> 00:47:03.696
So you forgave him.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.450
No, I just submitted the divorce papers.

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:10.161
Yeah! I feel so much better!

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:12.163
- That's great!
- That's great!

00:47:12.247 --> 00:47:15.166
Isn't it?
Today marks the start of my new life.

00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:16.584
All right!

00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:18.878
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:26.761
So... Is it okay if I talk about myself?

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:27.929
What is it?

00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:31.933
Today, I think I might ask Yuto out.

00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:42.610
Chef, do you have a girlfriend?

00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:45.029
Wanna come out drinking with us?

00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:48.199
The hyenas are out in full force it seems.

00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:51.494
But with all the chaos at this party,

00:47:51.578 --> 00:47:53.746
I feel like this is my chance
to make a move.

00:47:54.414 --> 00:47:56.457
My heart is racing!

00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.586
- Just to be clear though, Ms. Kanbe.
- Yeah.

00:47:59.669 --> 00:48:03.256
Please don't get upset when I steal
your first love away from you.

00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:05.258
Huh? Of course I won't!

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:08.720
I mean, that was back in high school!

00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:11.598
It's behind me now! Anyway, good luck!

00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:12.807
Thank you!

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:21.858 line:20%
I like you.

00:48:23.651 --> 00:48:25.820
I... I have a crush on you, Yuto.

00:48:26.362 --> 00:48:27.196
Huh?

00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:30.366
Please... go out with me!

00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:35.204
What are you...

00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:46.507
Thanks.

00:48:50.011 --> 00:48:50.845
But...

00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:52.847
- But?
- But?

00:48:53.556 --> 00:48:57.810
I'm closing the restaurant this month...
and going to France.

00:48:58.394 --> 00:48:59.854
France?!

00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:00.813
Yeah.

00:49:00.897 --> 00:49:03.358
I've found some closure here,

00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:05.902
and I want to gain more experience.

00:49:05.985 --> 00:49:09.155
My mentor from my training days
invited me to be the chef

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.865
at a new restaurant he's opening.

00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.575
- How long?
- Huh?

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.453
How long will you be in France?

00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:19.332
To start, about five years...

00:49:19.415 --> 00:49:20.458
Huh?!

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.920 line:20%
How could you not tell me about
something that important?

00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:26.673 line:20%
- Huh?
- I thought we had gotten close...

00:49:26.756 --> 00:49:29.759
We even spent New Year's together!

00:49:29.842 --> 00:49:30.677
Right...

00:49:31.219 --> 00:49:33.137
So you're closing the
cafe and it's just...

00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.430
Au revoir, à bientôt?

00:49:34.514 --> 00:49:37.934
Miku... your French is really good.

00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:41.437
Well... I was going to tell you today--

00:49:41.521 --> 00:49:42.939
That's too late!

00:49:43.898 --> 00:49:45.775
Everything's already been decided!

00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:47.944
I'm sorry...

00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:54.283
So, that's what I was to you, Yuto?

00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:57.328
The crust of the bread you
only eat when you're starving?

00:49:57.412 --> 00:49:59.789
No, I happen to like the crust actually.

00:49:59.872 --> 00:50:02.166
- I think I like it better than the--
- Enough.

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:04.419
I...

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:08.131
I hate you, Yuto!

00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:13.469
Miku?

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:19.142
She's such a child...

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.566
I know she's my sister,
but this is embarrassing.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:28.735
Oh, come on, she's adorable.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.702
- Is it my sister?
- Yes.

00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:38.911
What did she say?

00:50:38.995 --> 00:50:40.663
"My life is over."

00:50:41.748 --> 00:50:44.459
Please respond saying, "Grow up a little."

00:50:48.004 --> 00:50:49.380
I replied,

00:50:50.006 --> 00:50:51.966
"Or maybe it's just the beginning."

00:50:52.759 --> 00:50:56.053
Not knowing what happens next,
isn't that what love is all about?

00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:58.931
You sound like you're
speaking from experience.

00:50:59.474 --> 00:51:02.894
Yes, it was a turn of events
I never saw coming.

00:51:05.772 --> 00:51:07.940
Shall we set off
on a journey of our own, then?

00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:12.403
For now... towards 2025.

00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:25.458
Tapioca.

00:51:26.793 --> 00:51:28.795
Well, this is it! Dissatisfied?

00:51:30.129 --> 00:51:31.964
- Underwhelmed?
- Oh, no, it's not that.

00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:34.091
- It's just been so long.
- That's true.

00:51:34.175 --> 00:51:37.386
I'll leave it here. Will you eat it?

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.847
Food's ready.

00:51:39.931 --> 00:51:43.142
Okay. Wow! It looks delicious!

00:51:55.404 --> 00:51:58.407
<i>Who are you? What's your name?</i>

00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:26.727
Sorry. I kept you waiting. Okay!

00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:29.272
Then, here's this, and this.
Yes, also this.

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:40.199
Thank you very much.

00:52:47.123 --> 00:52:50.418
<i>And now, taking on the final trick,</i>
<i>it's Momiji Nishiya.</i>

00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:52.753
<i>She goes for it... and nails it!</i>

00:52:52.837 --> 00:52:55.506
<i>A huge cheer erupts from the crowd!</i>

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.633
<i>The score is in! 15.26 points!</i>

00:52:57.717 --> 00:52:59.594
<i>She's taken the lead,</i>
<i>she's in first place!</i>

00:52:59.677 --> 00:53:02.221
<i>Momiji Nishiya is our champion</i>
<i>at just 13 years old,</i>

00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:03.639
<i>taking home the gold medal!</i>

00:53:04.473 --> 00:53:05.558
Ohtani!

Everyone, thank you for your patience.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.592
Mamekame-dou is reopening
for the first time in ten years.

00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.552
Please, come in.

00:53:42.887 --> 00:53:43.804
Thank you.

00:53:43.888 --> 00:53:45.097
Welcome.

00:53:48.351 --> 00:53:50.102
Thank you.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.314
All right, thank you for waiting.
Here's the Mamekame set.

00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:54.607
Thank you.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:56.859
- Excuse me.
- I'll be right back to take your order.

00:53:56.943 --> 00:53:58.152
Please wait a moment.

00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:08.371
So many of the old regulars
came back for today.

00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.831
I'm so grateful.

00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:15.962
But are you really okay with this?

00:54:16.963 --> 00:54:23.386
Quitting that big company
to take over this little wagashi shop?

00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:27.932
After hearing stories from you,
the apprentices, and the regulars,

00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:29.767
I realized that I wanted to preserve

00:54:30.393 --> 00:54:34.939
the flavors and the warmth of this place
just the way the owner intended.

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.734
I appreciate how much you value it...

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.614
but I hope you'll start adding
more and more of your own touch as well.

00:54:44.949 --> 00:54:48.494
From here on, it's your generation's turn
to take the reins.

00:54:49.286 --> 00:54:52.957
Thank you. Oh, that's right, Chiyo!

00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:55.209
What do you think of this?

00:54:57.878 --> 00:54:58.713
Oh, wow!

00:54:59.922 --> 00:55:02.425
I thought it would be fun
if there's a prize once in a while.

00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:04.051
Keep it up!

00:55:12.935 --> 00:55:16.522
This is where my dream begins.

00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:23.070
Oh, by the way, he didn't show up today.

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.490
He is so busy.

00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:31.328
If you're staying, can you lock up later?

00:55:31.412 --> 00:55:32.246
Sure.

00:55:33.289 --> 00:55:35.166
Good work today, senpai.

00:55:35.833 --> 00:55:38.919
Seriously, please stop calling me senpai.

00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:53.142
Good morning, CEO!

00:55:54.769 --> 00:55:57.063
Another all-nighter for your thesis?

00:55:57.146 --> 00:56:01.150
Don't spread yourself too thinly between
work and your studies. Stay healthy, okay?

00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:05.112
Just launching the new food research lab
must be tough enough on its own.

00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:09.742
You came all the way out here
just to slack off?

00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:12.244
I'm here for an important inspection.

00:56:12.328 --> 00:56:15.873
Being section chief of the second
planning department has me all fired up.

00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:17.958
I've got big shoes to fill
after Ms. Kanbe.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.045
Stick with it.

00:56:22.088 --> 00:56:25.216
If anyone can do it, it's you, Miku.
I believe in you.

00:56:26.509 --> 00:56:28.427
Huh? What was that?

00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:29.720
So unlike you.

00:56:31.013 --> 00:56:32.264
You too!

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:38.145
Yeah, both have been my dream
for a long time after all.

00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:40.064
Good morning!

00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:41.607
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:56:46.946 --> 00:56:48.989
SEPTEMBER 18, 2025

00:56:49.073 --> 00:56:52.034
So, what is it that you're researching
at the university again?

00:56:52.118 --> 00:56:53.828
How many times have you asked me that?

00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:56.664
Well, I do remember
the word "bioscience."

00:56:56.747 --> 00:57:00.543
There are many regions around the world
where desertification is worsening, right?

00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:01.460
Yeah.

00:57:01.544 --> 00:57:03.087
If we can analyze genes

00:57:03.712 --> 00:57:06.715
and develop crops that grow
even in harsh conditions...

00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:07.633
SHINE MUSCAT

00:57:07.716 --> 00:57:09.176
...we can bring life to barren land.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.346
It's research that could
turn deserts green.

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:13.848
Hmm.

00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:16.225
- You think it's a pipe dream, right?
- No.

00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:18.310
I was thinking that it's perfect for you.

00:57:19.812 --> 00:57:21.772
It's been so long

00:57:21.856 --> 00:57:24.191
that I have to study everything
from the beginning...

00:57:24.275 --> 00:57:26.026
But I just thought it'd be good

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:29.321
if I could find hope for the future,
at university or at work.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.115
I'm cheering you on.

00:57:32.825 --> 00:57:33.659
You too, Misa.

00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:34.577
Hm?

00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:36.662
Please do what you want.

00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:37.872
Whatever it is.

00:57:39.957 --> 00:57:41.876
I'll always be here for you.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.223
Turn left up here.

00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:57.141
Okay.

00:58:25.044 --> 00:58:27.463
Am I seeing things, or...?

00:58:27.963 --> 00:58:30.799
No... That could have been him.

00:59:04.375 --> 00:59:06.669
Wow, I didn't know this was out here.

00:59:09.088 --> 00:59:13.217
So... Why don't we go over this way?

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.134
Sure.

00:59:19.098 --> 00:59:20.557
Beautiful...

00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:27.815
When you eat them from the bottom,
they gradually become sweeter, right?

00:59:33.654 --> 00:59:35.114
Did it get sweeter?

00:59:37.032 --> 00:59:38.117
Thanks to you.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.045
Do you remember what day today is?

00:59:53.132 --> 00:59:56.510
September 18, 2025.

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.514
The day my first life ended.

01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.309
Yes.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.856
But you're alive.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.444
Today will end...

01:00:15.696 --> 01:00:16.989
and tomorrow will come.

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:20.284
That's right.

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:29.877
Please marry me.

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:34.006
Huh?

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.135
Please...

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.680
marry me.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.104
But that's...

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:55.194
what I wanted to say!

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.780
I wanted to say it too.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.617
Remember what you said?

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.286
That I'm more attractive...

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:07.915
when I speak my mind
instead of holding back.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.544
In my first life,

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:15.089
today was the day I was suddenly
thrown back ten years.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.092
But I didn't feel alone, because...

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:25.307
you were always there for me.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.686
Whenever I was about to lose heart,

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:33.774
you were always there,
holding an umbrella over me.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.364
I want to...

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.951
walk with you, Wataru.

01:01:45.244 --> 01:01:47.204
Into our future that starts tomorrow.

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:51.041
I always want you by my side.

01:01:57.965 --> 01:01:59.508
You are...

01:02:02.428 --> 01:02:03.971
seriously...

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.028
I love you.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.742
I...

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.997
love you so much.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.877
And I always will.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.428
Wataru...

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.516
will you...

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:51.810
be my husband?

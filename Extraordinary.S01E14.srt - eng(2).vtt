WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.439
The three-day deadline is up.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:58.359
Where's the medicine?

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.719
Your Majesty.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.799
Shi Feifan deliberately stalled for time.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He might even be a spy from an enemy nation.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.840
I beg Your Majesty to arrest Shi Feifan now.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.040
And punish him severely.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.760
Prince Qing really spins tales with his words.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.319
He imagines a whole drama in his head.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.920
It's a shame he doesn't act on stage.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.079
Still stubborn even at death's door.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.840
How did Your Highness know

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.719
I hadn't made the medicine yet?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.719
Imperial Brother.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.840
Zhi'er.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.120
Why are you out? Be careful not to catch cold.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.280
Imperial Brother.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.319
Zhi'er took the medicine Shi Feifan prescribed.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:51.480
She's much better now.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.599
Zhi'er has been bedridden for days.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.079
She wanted to get some fresh air.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:58.840
How is that possible?

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.760
Impossible.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.840
Doesn't Your Highness want the Princess to recover?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240
Of course not.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.639
Luckily, I still have the prescription.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.520
No worries about making money.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.000
The Princess is cured.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.599
I'm so happy I'm rambling.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.439
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.400
Your Majesty.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.240
This details the method for making the medicine.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.840
I offer it freely.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.319
May Da Nan Chao's people be free from worry.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.360
Good.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.759
Good.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.360
Prince Qing, this medicine

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.439
is best kept for yourself.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.759
Why are you still standing here?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.960
Wasn't the medicine stolen?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.000
Who sent you here?

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:03.639
Not talking, huh?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.159
Celestial Star Tower again.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.800
Open your mouth.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.360
With this medicine, in fifteen minutes

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.199
you'll bleed from every orifice and die.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.920
Will you talk or not?

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:47.319
I...

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.639
I... I really don't know anything.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:51.240
I only know someone told me to get the medicine

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.600
and deliver it to the four big medicine shops.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.759
Please, I don't want to die.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.279
This is the antidote.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.720
But...

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.120
It's not exactly.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.079
It contains Gu bugs I've raised carefully.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.279
They can eat a person's heart and liver.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.720
I'm begging you.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.959
I've told you everything I know.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.680
I don't know anything else.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:16.959
Don't be afraid.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.480
Go back and say

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600
you've delivered the medicine.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:21.079
As long as you behave,

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.639
the Gu bug will leave your body in seven days.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.199
It'll be expelled automatically.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.959
Understand?

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.240
Yes, yes.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.000
Do you understand?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.639
I understand.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.759
Young Duke.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.279
You really know Gu magic?

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.399
What, want to see it?

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:56.240
This is it.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.839
Young Duke, don't eat it carelessly.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.879
Spit it out quickly!

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:03.319
This...

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.040
This is my new creation.

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.199
Compound Mylise.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.279
It's full of vitamins.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.199
You try it too.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:15.199
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.879
Send more people.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.519
Investigate quickly

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240
who the Master of Celestial Star Tower is.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.240
Yes.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.519
You are...

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.839
Someone sent me to deliver medicine.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.680
So you're a guest sent by the Master.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.759
Please, come in.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.439
Master.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:42.480
Master said

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:45.519
this medicine is only for you, Mr. Zhao.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.079
Once this medicine is released,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.040
its price will be immeasurable.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.000
Please wait a moment.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.079
Thank you, Master.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:06.240
Thank you, Master.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.960
A face with sharp features.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.879
Thick, rebellious eyebrows.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.679
Long, slightly curled eyelashes.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.799
A handsome, straight nose.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.799
And...

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:27.360
Is it good-looking?

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:29.320
No.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.519
Then why stare for so long?

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.360
People often say

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.200
a life-saving favor should be repaid with marriage.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.000
The Princess is different.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.960
She won't even praise me once.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.879
Such nice weather.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.799
I should've taken you somewhere nice.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.399
Where to?

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.919
You'll know once you recover.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.360
For now, let's exercise.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.080
Let's go.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:08.840
Come on, follow me.

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:10.879
Stretch out.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.679
That's right.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.559
That's right.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.559
Just like that.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:20.000
What a perfect couple they are.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.039
Youth is wonderful.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.279
Yes, they're a great match.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.919
That's right.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.759
What are you doing?

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:32.720
Turn around.

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:36.399
Turn.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.399
Aren't they just exercising?

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.120
The Young Duke often takes me to exercise too.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:43.279
But...

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.879
The Princess is better at it.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.480
Do it again.

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:47.519
The Young Duke isn't even using a whip.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.639
Ping'an.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.600
Looks like you'll never get married.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.000
It's tough.

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:16.840
You should find a chance to talk to His Majesty.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.000
A beauty in white, breeze rising.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.320
Where in the world isn't there a fairy?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.480
Young Duke, you're here.

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:34.039
Come.

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:35.919
All set.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.559
Here.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.200
Ping'an.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.399
Serve the dishes.

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:41.600
Alright, alright.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.919
What dishes are we serving, Young Duke?

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:45.039
Doesn't matter what dishes.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.080
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.720
Such a beautiful view, let's have a drink.

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:02.360
Wait.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.120
Is this the surprise you prepared for me?

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:32.759
Do you like it?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.039
I do.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.879
Fanner's mother,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.320
our Fanner

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:16.919
has grown up.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.679
Fanner has grown up.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.159
Your Majesty.

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:47.080
Minister Shi, you arrived just in time.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.159
It's been a long time since we played chess together.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.000
Come, come.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.159
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:09.519
How should I say it

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:13.440
so it doesn't sound forced or careless?

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:26.799
Minister Shi, help me take a look.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.919
Did I win?

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.840
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.000
Minister Shi, your chess skills are getting worse.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:38.600
But your skill at raising a son has improved.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.519
The Duke's Mansion has done well this time.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.120
Tell me, what reward do you want?

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.639
Your Majesty, please grant a marriage.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.279
Minister Shi has been widowed for a long time.

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:57.919
It's time to remarry.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.440
Your Majesty, you misunderstood.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:05.279
Please grant the Princess to my foolish son.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.360
The Princess's Consort

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:15.480
must be the most outstanding consort.

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:18.960
If Young Duke Shi wants to be the consort,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.960
he should keep improving himself.

Good morning.

from what she did.

Whoa!

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.400
The omelet looks wonderful!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.360

Even better,
I get to have lunch with my wife.

for your claustrophobia,

how's it going?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.080
Mm...

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.560
I just started the treatment,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.060
but I think it's going really well.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.400
As for my amaxophobia, I'm also better now.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080
Soon enough, I think
I'll be able to hit the road like usual.

Well, then...

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.000
I'd like to be with you
when you see the therapist.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.280
Would that be okay?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.700

Oh...

I don't mean that...

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.720
Then why didn't you answer me?

Oh...

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.040

aren't you?

I should've brought you with me
from the start.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.720
You've never told me
you're worried about me.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.080
Stop talking nonsense.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.296

if you've been spending my money

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.120
on something actually useful.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960
If it's something trivial,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.240
I'll make you pay me back
a million times over.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.080
Oh...

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.860
Absolutely!

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.625
I'll send you the schedule

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.170
so that you might be able to
free up your time in advance.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560

for many years, too.

you'll see that

I've always been by your side.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.880
Stop speaking falsely about Prapai

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.960
and get out of here.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.720

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.040
and embrace her.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.941

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.480
which she'll throw away when she's done.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.840
You're smart about everything,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.560
but when it comes to this,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.040
why can't you see it through?

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.120
I thought I was a fool,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.400
but you're way worse than me.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.040
Get out of my life.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.600
Wait, Rin.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.200
All you're good at is lying to yourself,
aren't you?

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.800
You told me to go away?

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.440
That's fine.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.160
I'll go,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.040
but before I do,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.800
can I tell you one last thing?

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.360
I don't want you to hate Prapai.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.120
I just want you to love yourself,
for goodness' sake.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.640
Take care, Rin.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.640
Prapai.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.240
Take it easy.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.520
Have a drink

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.080
and stop crying.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.240
I'll call Kiri.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.380
I'll be right back.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480
Rin.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.320
Where's Prapai?

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560
Follow me.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.200
Prapai!

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240
Are you okay?

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720
I'm sorry, Prapai.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.400
I didn't think it'd end up like this.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.240
It has always been,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.080
but you didn't even try.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.160
You're not going to do anything?

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.200
Now, do you realize

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.040
how much she has suffered?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.880
Are you really going to let your mother

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.880
keep hurting someone you love?

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.440
I just didn't think it'd end up like this.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.840
My mother...

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.200
Then do everything in your power
for your loved one,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.360
and stop being so gullible.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.600
Prapai chose you,

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.840
so be the person who my loved one deserves.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.520
Now that things have unfolded this way,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.240
you may have to make a choice.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.920
And...

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.280
I've never wanted to say this,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.320
but you have to choose between
your mother and your girlfriend.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.400
You can only choose one of them.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480
Kiri.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.000
Do you want to be a loyal son,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.520
or a good father

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.680
and husband?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.440
Prapai.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200
You're pregnant?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.560
Hey, Kiri.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.080
Be honest.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.840
Do you even have a plan about this?

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.090
Your mother hates Prapai to the bone,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.800
and what's worse,
she's carrying your child.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.960
The child needs a father, Kiri.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.480
I've made my choice.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.840
I want to make Prapai happy

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.600
without my mother's influence.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.760
What's your plan?

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.600
My plan has always been

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.200
to live abroad with Prapai.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.720
We'll start a new life there.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.760
I'm going to leave everything

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.760
my mom gave me behind

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.520
and start a new family.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.640
Prapai.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.520
What about you?
Where are you going from here?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.920
Wherever you go,

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.800
I'll follow.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.280
I guess it's time.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320
If my mother

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.520
hurts my loved one,

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.560
I'll take my leave

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.560
and start a new life.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.080
I hope that

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.320
you're not the one
who'll make Prapai call me again.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.040
If she doesn't call me,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.360
it means

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.680
she's doing well.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.960
I've got to go.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.960
Rin, please wait.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.720
Good luck out there.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.320
I'm sorry for everything.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.400
And...

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.120
Thank you very much.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.640
From now on,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.400
please consider me

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.000
as your older sister, okay?

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.520
Please go back to Kiri.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.960
Hello, Grace.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.420
Could you get everyone together for me?

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.680
I don't want to go home.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.480
Malai,

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.400
did Khem just go upstairs?

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.560
Uh...

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.320
Mrs. Khem... She...

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.080
What is it? What happened?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.280
This afternoon, Khem told your father
she was taking her leave.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.920
She also had packed up everything and left.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.240
To where?

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.240
I have no idea.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.080
She only said somewhere else.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.400
Then she packed up everything.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.600
Khem...

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.080
Did you have a fight?

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.440
Well...

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.880
A little bit.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.640
Dad, do you know

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.320
where Khem is?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.320
Khem said goodbye to me

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.520
and canceled the agreement.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.360
And...

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.830
She gave me this ring to return to you.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.080
What does this mean?

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.560
Why did she return her wedding ring?

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.280
That means you two have broken up.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.520
From now on, it's settled.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.240
Khem was the one who gave up.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.160
You beat her, Rin.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.760
Do you know where she's off to?

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520
I have no clue.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.760
She already told me she'd quit the job

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.440
and said she'd submit
her letter of resignation.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.480
And I already said yes.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.560
Dad!

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.760
Why didn't you talk to me first?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.360
Mookhem...

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760
Mookhem...

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.640
Why did you take Mookhem with you?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.680
If you're happy without me,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.320
I'll leave.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.840
I'm sorry for hurting you all this time.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.320
I'm sorry for not being good enough.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.650
Please eat well,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.320
sleep well,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.720
and live a happy life.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.360
I've given up.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.560
One day, our paths might cross again

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.480
as someone to each other.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.040
But please remember that
I will still love you when that day comes.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.120
Every minute I spent with you

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.040
truly overwhelmed me with joy.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.680
You said you loved me so much,

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.640
so why did you have to run away?

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.320
No! No!

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.040
Rin!

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.080
Rin!

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.640
You're not alone, Rin.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.200
I love you.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.480
Please have a rest, Rin.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.400
I love you.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.080
I've been doing all this for you,

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.240
and I'll keep doing it forever,

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.880
until the last second of my life.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.320
You're as precious as fine wine.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.040
The more it ages,

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.320
the better it tastes.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.400
And fine wine is...

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.800
perfect for someone who doesn't know
how to drink it, like me.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.880
Please don't go, Rin.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.840
Can you stop messing with me?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.800
I'm going,
and who do you think you are to stop me?

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.435
At the end of the day,
you'll be nothing more than

00:35:14.459 --> 00:35:16.080
a napkin for her to wipe her tears with,

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.080
which she'll throw away when she's done.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.160
I thought I was a fool,

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.040
but you're way worse than me.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.960
Get out of my life.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.560
Go wherever you want.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.640
Why should I care?

00:36:16.752 --> 00:36:20.680
[3 days later]

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.160
You...

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:23.920
Hey!

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.280
You crazy girl!

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.280
Have you finished it?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.200
Not yet.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360
So, when?

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.480
Do you know

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.120
where Khem is?

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.600
We have no idea, Boss.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.760
Um...

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.480
She just said that she was going to quit.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.840
That surprised us too, actually.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.680
I never thought it'd happen so soon.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.240
Well...

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.720
If Khem reaches out to you,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.560
tell her to call me.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400
- Yes, Boss.
- Got it, Boss.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.680
Hey, I think something's not right.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.720
Yeah.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.560
Is it really over between them?

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.560
That's what everybody thinks.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.720
I don't want to believe it, though.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.280
It seemed like
Boss really adored her back there.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:17.880
Yeah.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.320
She even dealt with Gee herself.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:21.490
Mm.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.560
Guys!

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.720
- I've got something to tell you.
- What is it?

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.240
I saw the message on the group chat.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.480
They say they didn't get married
because they loved each other.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.040
Huh?!

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.480
What makes you believe that?

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.240
I didn't see her wearing a ring
on her ring finger.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280
Nonsense.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.520
I still saw her wearing one.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.680
You're right.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.400
I have meetings with her
every week, though.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.360
I've only just noticed
her wearing the ring.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.360
That means...

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.840
The gossip that has been going around

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.080
is only half true.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.280
But actually...

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.640
Boss and Khem...

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.880
- love each other!
- They love each other!

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.440
I knew it.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.360
It's true.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520
Kwanrin.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.880
Khem is staying with you, isn't she?

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.760
Uh...

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.240
She's not with me.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.080
You have to know where she's gone.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640
Kwanrin.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.440
Please tell me.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.560
I want to take her home.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.640
We've gone our separate ways,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.680
and...

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.960
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.400
Please excuse me.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.920
Excuse me, the dinner's ready.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.960
Would you like to have it now?

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.240
No, thank you.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.360
Tell Dad to have dinner without me.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.760
Yes.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.680
Mookhem...

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.880
Why did you have to take Mookhem?

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.640
Malai.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.760
About four of the girls
I asked you to call,

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.920
have you taken care of them?

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.400
Yes, I have.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.360
Why are you guys calling me?

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.840
I'm not in the mood for a chit-chat.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.280
This is why I'm calling you.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.840
Go have something to eat,
for goodness' sake.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.800
No.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160
I'm not going.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.080
Rin, you've been drinking every day.

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:24.310
You're going to die.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.480
Yeah.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.040
I want to die.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.710
Can you please help me?

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.400
I want to end this.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.000
If you're not helping me,

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.320
just hang up.
I don't want to hear anything from you.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.800
Rin.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.400
You're not weak.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.360
It's just that
you haven't admitted you're hurt.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.520
You miss Khem, don't you?

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.160
Everything's over,

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.960
and I caused it.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.640
Ms. Rin.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.680
Your dad would like to talk to you.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.960
Dad.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.240
Can I have your stash of liquor

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.320
now that you've quit drinking?

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.520
Please give me another bottle.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.920
Just one more bottle, please, Dad.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.880
- Dad, I'm only asking for one more bottle.
- That's enough, Rin.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.720
I don't know why you're crying.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.160
You want her to go away from you,
don't you?

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.880
And she's done just that.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.800
Why aren't you satisfied yet, dear?

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.000
It hasn't yet been 2 years.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.100
That kid...

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.080
She broke the agreement.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.160
Dad.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.430
You have to drag her here.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.790
She humiliated me.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.880
- How dare she violate the agreement?
- Rin.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.800
Pull yourself together
and try to think about

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.320
what you really want.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.200
If you truly don't want Khem in your life

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.920
or don't actually love her,

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.700
just let her go.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.530
If she wants to live the way she wants

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.440
just let her be.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.700
You have to pick yourself up
and be a good girl.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.640
Only then will you become President.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.200
When are you going to make me President?

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.840
The moment you're ready, Rin.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.680
If you keep drinking like this,

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.480
I'm afraid I cannot.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.640
No one wants a drunk president.

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600
Dad...

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:15.800
Bring Khem to me.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.440
I don't want to be President anymore.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.360
You're hiding her from me, aren't you?

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.120
Give Khem back to me.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.920
Where did you take her to?

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.120
Dad.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.320
I don't know where she went.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.040
You win, Dad.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.440
Please, Dad.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.560
I need her.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.840
Dad...

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.400
Dad, can you please

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.240
find my husband?

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.240
I love her.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.840
Do you hear that I love her?

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.640
Can you please help me find Khem?

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.080
Please.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.000
Rin.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.600
Khem wants to live her own life,

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.640
free from our presence.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.480
I don't know where she is.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.960
Dad...

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.240
Please bring Khem back to me.

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:09.650
I can't bear this pain any longer.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.760
I can't take it anymore.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.760
Okay, okay.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.880
I understand, dear.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.480
Please help me, Dad.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.320
Mm.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.360
Pull yourself together, dear.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.960
Get a hold of yourself.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.440
Go take a bath,

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.440
then have a meal with me.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680
I promise you

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.720
I'll find her.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.000
Promise?

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.240
I love Khem. Do you hear me?

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.680
I do. I do...

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.960
It's okay. Don't cry.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.640
It's okay.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.720
I'll find her.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.480
Can you please come back to me?

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.680
[Director: Thanamin Wongsakulpach]

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.720
Let's have dinner with me.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.200
I'm not hungry.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.720
I'm really scared, dear.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.400
I almost lost you once,

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.440
and I won't let it happen again.

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.600
Khem actually told me
not to tell you where she is

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.640
but I don't want her
to suffer forever either.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.280
I'll tell you where Khem is.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.960
Khem.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.320
Rin?

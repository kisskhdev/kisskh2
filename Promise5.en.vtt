00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.910
Your call will be forwarded to voicemail.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.110
The bill will be charged after the beep.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.980
Why hasn't Ye Haiyuan come back yet?

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.140
I'm so hungry.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.539
But if I go out,
I'll run into Guan Riqing.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.240
This is for you.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.920
It's food.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.660
Thank you, Qiansui.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:53.890
Don't thank me.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.650
Ye Haiyuan asked me to bring it.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.480
Qiansui.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.280
I'm playing games.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.230
Little brother.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.270
Are you free after work tonight?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.040
Stop teasing him.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.220
Here.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.990
Margaret.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.980
Hana.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.530
The part-timer at your store
is really handsome.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.770
He works hard.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.170
But he has a bad temper.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.840
Ye Haiyuan.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.640
A guest at the counter bought it for you.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.480
People treat you to drinks every day.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.000
And there are tips too.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.950
I thought I was running a host bar.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.920
Thank you, Haru.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.390
Tell me.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.790
How much would it take
to spend a night with you?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.800
Don't teach bad things to kids.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.570
Just kidding.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.120
He's young and cold all day.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.600
I saw him last time with a friend.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.630
He's pretty cute.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.820
Who is it?

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.380
Bring him to the store next time.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.200
No.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.950
Haiyuan has a new friend?

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.350
What kind of person is he?

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.490
You seem to care about Ye Haiyuan a lot.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.660
I don't.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.360
You do.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.920
I don't.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.690
You do.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.590
I don't.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.930
So cute.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.800
One more kiss.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.140
Ye Haiyuan sleeps during class and
works after class.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.080
Hurry up and come back to chat with me.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.000
Good boy, you sleep here.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.070
Do you fall asleep or not?

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.000
I told you to come back early.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.410
It's not safe outside.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.310
You worry about me?

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.650
I don't have anyone to chat with.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.700
You can ignore Zefang,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.310
but you can't ignore me.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.330
Why?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.380
Because I'm Xia Cha.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.000
I went to help the professor
with organizing his thesis.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.060
Qiansui went to study at the library.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.170
Remember to go to class later.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.100
Your handwriting is quite nice.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.910
Midterm exam?

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.370
Isn't it the important exam
that Zefang mentioned?

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.020
If I don't do well, I'll fail.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.550
I might even get expelled.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.360
Will I ruin Zefang's future?

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.240
Haiyuan!

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.210
Haiyuan!

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.480
Ye Haiyuan!

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.320
Here.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.360
Thank you for your notes.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.130
But the handwriting
doesn’t seem like yours.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.470
You especially borrowed them
for me, didn’t you?

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.730
I was afraid you would keep pestering me.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.670
I read the notes,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.000
but I didn’t understand them.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Would you like to teach me?

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.900
No.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.130
I won’t let you help me for free.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.080
I’ll take care of your food and drinks.
How about that?

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.580
I need to work. I’m busy.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.500
I don't care.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.930
If you don't agree,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.460
I’ll just keep hugging you
and pestering you.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.830
How’s that?

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.970
Are you scared of
being pestered by Zefang like this?

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.640
I don't mind.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.860
Why are you getting so close to me?

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.180
You came close to me.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.860
Aren’t you the one
who wanted to get close to me?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.900
You little kid...

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.200
If it weren't for you,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.370
Zefang and I wouldn’t be like this today.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.050
You have to take responsibility.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:31.930
How?

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.180
Anyway,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.790
you have to take me seriously.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.280
From the bottom of your heart.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.050
How did I suddenly fall asleep?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.250
Why didn't you wake me up when you left?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.360
Boy, studying is hard.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.720
Would you like some tea?

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.910
Come on.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.950
Have some tea.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.380
Studying is hard.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.820
Weird, why did everyone leave?

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.950
What are you going to do?

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.320
What are you going to do?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.220
I raised you so well before.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.070
Change your clothes.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.840
Here, the latest one.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.170
What do you mean?

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.410
I'm fine.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.510
Now you don’t even look like you.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.780
What do you like about Zefang?

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.810
Why was he with you?

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.080
Wasn’t it good between us before?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.100
I'll buy you whatever you want.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.290
If you don't like anyone,
I'll beat him up.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.290
As long as you ask.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.090
You and Zefang have problems.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.370
Stop it. Come back with me.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.530
What are you doing? Let go of me!

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.730
Let's go. Stop it.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.970
Help!

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.640
Help me!

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.180
Help me!

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.570
Help!

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.630
Stop it, Xia Zefang.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.700
What are you doing?

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.930
Thank you.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.250
For what?

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.510
A student reported an issue with 103
using unauthorized electrical appliances.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.970
I'm here to confiscate it.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.560
But my tea is expensive.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.330
It costs 3,000 yuan per catty.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.930
When will you give it back to me?

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.900
I'm very angry.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.710
How could Zefang be with Guan Riqing

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.480
because of those reasons?

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.260
You and Guan Riqing.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.960
One is self-abased
and the other is arrogant.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.220
It’s a perfect match for mutual benefit.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.410
Isn’t Zefang in love with Haiyuan?

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.510
Did you really forget

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.310
or did you forget it on purpose?

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.270
Many people chased after you,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.470
but you refused them.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.430
You were only interested in Ye Haiyuan.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.550
But then, for some reason,

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.210
you ended up with Guan Riqing.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.120
But he’s a pretty good guy.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.070
If you were not happy with someone,
he’d beat them up.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.130
If you wanted something, he’d buy it.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.510
How could Zefang do this?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.410
I'm not afraid you'll get mad.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.180
Using moral kidnapping or

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.600
emotional blackmail
at this school won't work.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.280
But now you’re doing much better.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.450
If it were in the past,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.380
I wouldn’t even want to talk to you.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.960
Did I do something wrong

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.600
that made you like this?

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.500
Why did you say that?

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.100
Zefang lost his parents when he was young.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.570
I spoiled him.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.510
I only found out recently

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.740
that everyone didn’t like him.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.990
You are not Xia Zefang.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:05.610
Who are you?

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:07.150
Smart.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.990
If I told you,
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.180
I'm not Xia Zefang.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.970
I’m his grandpa, Xia Cha.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.670
We had an accident after we got back.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.400
We both fell to our deaths.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.910
I’m alive.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.040
Anyway, my body was burned,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.370
but my soul moved into Zefang’s body.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.000
No wonder I felt like

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.080
your smell was different this time.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.410
But I heard Ye Haiyuan call you Cha.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.520
So he knew about this?

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.920
Yes.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.080
He was there when I woke up.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.320
But he told me not to tell others.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.420
He didn't want to trouble Zefang.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.050
That's right.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.520
After all, the soul exchange thing

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.290
is a bit magical.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.900
I'm psychic.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.500
Let me check.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.330
Can it be connected like this?

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.880
Could you ask

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.290
where Zefang’s soul went?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:15.850
Haiyuan.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.690
Why did he turn and leave?

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:27.760
How would I know?

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.020
Haiyuan.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.300
Ye Haiyuan!

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.580
Ye Haiyuan!

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.680
Where is he?

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.170
Why is he angry for no reason?

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.870
Is it because Qiansui and I were too close?

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.870
Or

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.350
he saw the clothes Guan Riqing
bought for me?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.350
People get angry because they care.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.030
When someone cares about you,
you have to cherish him.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.150
I heard that the new dorm supervisor
has magical powers.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.200
He knows everything.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.280
Help yourself.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.839
Eat.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.560
I want to ask

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.790
is there a way to cut off
bad luck with love relationships?

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.960
Cut off bad luck with love relationships?

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.800
About who?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.630
Guan Riqing and Zefang.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.930
Zefang?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.100
Guan Riqing and me,

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.300
me.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.120
No need to do fortune-telling.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.390
First,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.110
you have to cut ties with Ye Haiyuan

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.350
before doing that.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.750
No.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.100
It seems

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.910
you chose Ye Haiyuan
instead of Guan Riqing.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.730
Why?

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440
I...

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.880
Recently, rumor has it that

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.140
Ye Haiyuan went into the business
of being a host for money.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.750
Is he better than Guan Riqing?

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.710
Nonsense!

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.460
Haiyuan is not that kind of person.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:36.390
He comes back every night with
the smell of cigarettes and alcohol.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.530
He even climbed the wall
when the door was locked.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.930
It's dangerous.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.300
I'm leaving.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.300
Wait.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.840
Take this.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.040
Take it.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.490
Money is very important.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.880
You can do many things.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.920
This is your commission for performance.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.570
Take it.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.390
Prepare for the midterm exams.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.490
You don't have to come here recently.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.270
No.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.660
Hana will be too busy.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.630
I’ll feel bad.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.630
Ignore her.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.670
I'll take care of it.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.640
Bye. See you tomorrow.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.350
Your performance is so good.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.690
I'll be worried if you leave like this.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.090
What are you doing?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.690
Smell of cigarettes, alcohol

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.670
and perfume.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.810
A customer treated me to drinks.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.940
Could it be that the rumors
in the dorm are true?

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.180
Is Haiyuan really doing this for money?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.380
This is not what a student should do!

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.590
Do you know that?

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.960
Why are you getting so close to me?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.290
You came close to me.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.350
He was angry because
Guan Riqing wanted to rape him.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.610
It can also explain it.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.390
He doesn't want it at all.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.790
But when I saw Qiansui
getting close to Cha,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.990
I was jealous.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.760
Why?

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.670
Why are you still here?

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.060
What are you doing here?

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.530
I'm going to take a shower too.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.220
Let's go together.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.640
There's no hot water after 12 o'clock.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.050
You should wash earlier next time.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.250
I want to wait for you.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.730
Hello, Hana.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.430
You mean the key to my warehouse?

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.690
Okay, I'll look for it.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.030
I’ll wait for you to wash together.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.550
Wash up.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.860
Wash up. It's so nice.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.860
The power is out.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.860
Who?

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.650
Haiyuan.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.510
Ye Haiyuan.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.410
Open the door!

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.630
Haiyuan.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.380
Haiyuan.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.850
Let me out!

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.080
Stop playing!

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.020
Let me out!

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.820
Open the door!

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.490
Open the door!

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.300
Open the door.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:39.710
Cha.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.670
Cha.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.220
Cha, what's wrong?

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.330
What happened to you?

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.460
The light suddenly turned off

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.260
and the door couldn't be opened.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.110
Who did this?

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.840
How would I know?

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.640
I thought you were joking.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.070
Then why did you fall down?

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:22.550
It's strange.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.900
I was suddenly panicked.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.160
My heart tightened.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.100
I couldn't breathe.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.620
I felt dizzy and wanted to throw up.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.490
You have claustrophobia.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.440
What is that?

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.180
It’s like,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.360
being afraid of darkness
and narrow spaces.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.570
I'm not.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.600
That’s not manly.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.570
Maybe Xia Zefang has it?

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.020
Why does Zefang have so many problems?

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.310
So even if we exchange souls,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.550
the body will remember what happened.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.660
Does that mean

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.490
once I get over the psychological barrier,

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.600
I can swim?

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.430
I can help Zefang make more records.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.800
You almost couldn’t breathe just now.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.860
Could you think about yourself more?

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.700
You're the one living in this body now.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.310
Are you worried about me?

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.840
I’m afraid you might accidentally die
in the bathroom.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.680
Then you’d better watch me closely.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.580
[Why should I watch you closely?
Because I’m afraid you’ll run away.
I see now, the feeling of
wanting someone by your side is like this]

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.270
You're drunk.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.800
One more.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.040
Just one more.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.590
Then let's celebrate after drinking it.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.230
Your performance is so good.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.980
Qiansui found out that I'm not Zefang.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.450
I didn't expect
Qiansui to be psychic.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.650
So he tested the spiritual power.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.490
The clothes on the ground

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.490
were given to Zefang by Guan Riqing.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.770
But I refused.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.230
But he ran away after he threw it here.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.830
Give it back for me when you come back.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.750
Help!

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.220
[Next Episode Preview]

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.080
Do you believe in past lives

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.820
or soul reincarnation?

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.260
Like a dream.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.930
The inexplicable fear.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.300
The trust in strangers.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.530
It proves that

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.640
there might be a reincarnation.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.930
So you were the person
who troubled Haiyuan

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:03.730
the other day.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.510
Why are you so sure
that I did all the bad things?

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:07.810
Cha.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.320
When Zefang comes back,

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.280
you have to give him a chance.

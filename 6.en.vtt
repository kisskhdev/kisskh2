[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.215
What are you doing here?

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.785
Just marry Maiden Sun Chaek already.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.355
Why did you have to do this?

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:44.435
What are you talking about?

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:45.875
Maiden Eun Ae...

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.535
She participated in the selection to marry you.

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:50.715
So?

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:52.835
Do you...

00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:57.185
Do you really not know how I feel?

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.095
How am I supposed to know how you feel?

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:10.235
I love Maiden Eun Ae.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:14.825
If she ends up getting selected,

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.605
what am I supposed to do?

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:20.885
You scared me for that reason?

00:01:23.105 --> 00:01:25.485
Do not belittle this matter.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.135
My life depends on it.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.655
My Lord.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.895
I caught him as he was running away.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.875
Where is he?

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.695
This way.

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:45.395
I am not done yet-

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.985
Beon!

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:05.725
Just kill me.

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:11.315
You must know about this

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:14.515
filthy object better than anyone.

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:17.555
Did the Do family hire you?

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:24.845
Why did you approach Cha Sun Chaek?

00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:38.995
You did such a thing without being

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:41.345
prepared to go through this?

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:45.995
Compared to the pain my woman had to endure,

00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:48.485
it is not even close.

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:10.125
Just make sure he does not die.

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:11.555
Yes, sir.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:16.685
Did you say he got off the ship
that belongs to the Do family?

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:18.605
Yes, as soon as he got off,

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:23.415
I confirmed that he went to
the Right State Minister's house.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:25.635
Do Hwa Seon will be the key to this.

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:27.635
What are you planning to do?

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:31.415
I need to find evidence from her directly.

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:33.295
Directly?

00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:37.965
You will not seduce her, will you?

00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:45.915
It might look suspicious.

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.795
Do not tell anyone.

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.725
Not even Lady Sun Chaek?

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:56.625
She might end up in danger.

00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:05.295
In the pouches, there are 10 nyang worth of coins.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:11.425
Increase the worth of 10 nyang in two days.

00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:17.625
That is the task I am giving you.

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:25.855
[Episode 6: Fishing ground and disguise]

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:31.145
It's such a difficult task.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:35.505
It's a task suited for the Queen.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:40.825
You have an advantage
since you've run a merchant store.

00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:43.425
I really can't think of anything.

00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:48.235
I think it is about wisdom
rather than business skills.

00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:50.905
That's even harder.

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:57.175
My Lady!

00:05:05.755 --> 00:05:09.345
Bang Wool, do you have any good ideas?

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:11.385
How would I know anything?

00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:15.725
I should've learned
about investing if I had known.

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:19.645
- My Lady.
- Yes?

00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:24.125
I am certain someone is following you.

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:25.745
Again?

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:32.895
Why don't you stop and come out now?

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:37.365
Otherwise, I'll tell Prince Gyengseong that

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:40.645
you followed me so obviously.

00:05:54.245 --> 00:05:55.745
How did you know?

00:05:55.745 --> 00:05:59.085
I knew you were Ma Yun
from the way you were acting.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:01.185
How do you know my name?

00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:03.625
I know a lot more

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:07.475
about this place than you think I do.

00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.575
<i>Still, why did you follow me so obviously?</i>

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.015
<i>I feel so uncomfortable.</i>

00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:13.445
<i>My Lord ordered me to</i>

00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:17.095
<i>protect you during the selection.</i>

00:06:17.095 --> 00:06:20.095
Tell him to protect me himself if he's so worried.

00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:23.125
He is not able to come himself.

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:24.155
Why not?

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:26.415
I cannot tell you just yet.

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:28.225
Don't follow me around, then.

00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:31.385
I cannot go against his order.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.625
Both you and your lord won't listen.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:36.415
From now on,

00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:40.605
I will protect you discreetly.

00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:50.515
Gosh, seriously!

00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:53.395
What the hell are you doing?

00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:57.315
I-I am sorry.

00:06:57.315 --> 00:06:59.095
How will you compensate for all this?

00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:00.715
Gosh, seriously.

00:07:00.715 --> 00:07:02.095
Geez.

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:03.965
I will compensate you.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.245
How much will it be?

00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:06.875
Because of the bad crops this year,

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:09.865
rice is impossible to get right now.

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:13.875
Rice is more precious than any treasure nowadays.

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:16.055
Even a nobleman's daughter

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:19.835
will not be able to compensate me for this.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.845
Geez.

00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:26.365
- Do not do it, My Lady.
- It's okay. Do it together.

00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:28.755
Your hands will get dirty.

00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.865
Seriously.

00:07:30.865 --> 00:07:33.415
How upsetting.

00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:35.015
Geez.

00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:40.795
Is that all you can do with 10 nyang?

00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.835
Your heads are good for nothing, are they not?

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:48.985
If your head is good for nothing,

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.165
why is it so big?

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:53.775
I suppose.

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:57.585
What do I expect from you people?

00:07:57.585 --> 00:08:00.135
You are so useless.

00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:03.635
I cannot stand you. Be gone!

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.225
Queen Mother acted like she would help me.

00:08:14.225 --> 00:08:16.415
But she did not give me any hint.

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:21.345
B-By chance, is she trying to test me, too?

00:08:21.345 --> 00:08:24.555
I do not know what she is thinking.

00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:26.545
If only he did not mess up,

00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:29.055
Prince Gyeongseong would have been mine.

00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:32.305
Now, he is nowhere to be seen.

00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:34.555
What a bastard.

00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:37.225
Whatever.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.855
Eating tasty food will give me an idea, right?

00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:40.545
Right.

00:08:45.005 --> 00:08:47.085
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:58.735
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:08:58.735 --> 00:09:02.065
Prince Gyeongseong! Prince Gyeongseong...

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:06.085
Huh? What's going on? Was I mistaken?

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:08.885
I don't think so.

00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:22.875
Watch where you are going!

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:30.025
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:09:30.025 --> 00:09:31.775
I ran into you again.

00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:33.835
Is this fate, too?

00:09:57.225 --> 00:10:00.775
I wanted to say hello to the maidens
participating in the selection.

00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:01.995
I am glad I ran into you.

00:10:01.995 --> 00:10:03.555
It is my mistake,

00:10:03.555 --> 00:10:07.665
but I am not sure if I can let a man inside.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:11.085
I could become your husband in the future.

00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:12.795
My gosh.

00:10:13.955 --> 00:10:15.835
I would like to get changed.

00:10:15.835 --> 00:10:17.765
Oh, come this way.

00:10:17.765 --> 00:10:19.465
And...

00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:21.295
I am a bit thirsty, too.

00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:22.555
I will get you something.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.585
Please wait inside.

00:10:29.055 --> 00:10:31.835
You had better not go anywhere.

00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:39.215
Would you like cold or warm water...

00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:40.455
Oh, gosh!

00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:43.265
I felt stuffy, so...

00:11:47.195 --> 00:11:49.535
<i>You can take off more.</i>

00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:51.735
I got you water.

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:02.825
I prefer tea over water.

00:12:02.825 --> 00:12:04.285
Tea is nice.

00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:07.165
I will brew you a strong one.

00:12:07.165 --> 00:12:12.785
I would like you to brew it as long as you can.

00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:16.215
Yes. I will get it for you.

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:33.855
What is the point of working so hard?

00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:37.055
It is indeed a bad year of harvest.

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:39.645
The nobles do not know.

00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:42.235
It has been like this for a while.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:50.895
<i>We are screwed.</i>

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.765
<i>The ground looks good, though.</i>

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:55.275
Excuse me.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.025
Are you the owner of this field?

00:12:57.025 --> 00:13:00.015
- Why do you ask?
- Can I borrow this place briefly?

00:13:00.015 --> 00:13:03.165
Will you plant rice in this bad crop year?

00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:04.955
I'm thinking of growing something else.

00:13:04.955 --> 00:13:07.555
I will borrow it just for two days.

00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:11.935
Here.

00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:14.165
Will this be enough?

00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:19.085
I wonder if there's one.

00:13:22.545 --> 00:13:25.645
What? What's this noise?

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:30.405
My Lady, look that way.

00:13:41.335 --> 00:13:44.795
What a shock out of the blue.

00:13:44.795 --> 00:13:49.375
I am about to lose both a friend and a woman.

00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.925
I understand how that feels, too.

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:57.065
I should step aside now, should I not?

00:13:57.065 --> 00:14:02.335
Can you give up on the woman
you love for a friend?

00:14:08.155 --> 00:14:10.925
How close is he to Prince Gyeongseong?

00:14:10.925 --> 00:14:13.055
<i>It was not in the book.</i>

00:14:13.055 --> 00:14:15.495
<i>But I've always been curious.</i>

00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:36.295
You cannot even kill it.

00:14:43.965 --> 00:14:46.925
- Should I cut you first?
- Go ahead and try.

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:50.535
"Life and death share the same body.

00:14:50.535 --> 00:14:53.025
Just as hardship and growth come hand in hand."

00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:57.435
That is what my late mother said.

00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:18.635
"Neung" as in despise. "So" as in the sky.

00:15:18.635 --> 00:15:21.185
No matter how poor the weather is,

00:15:21.185 --> 00:15:23.795
it blossoms without care.
That is why it is called that.

00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:25.415
You and I...

00:15:25.415 --> 00:15:28.625
seem to be going through hardship.

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:32.775
Let us hang in there like this flower and blossom.

00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:35.125
All right?

00:15:45.475 --> 00:15:49.035
<i>I am Beon's only friend.</i>

00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:51.595
<i>But how could I...</i>

00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:55.015
possibly betray him?

00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:59.725
But don't be so sad.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:02.945
Lady Eun Ae didn't want to participate, either.

00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:04.455
I-Is that true?

00:16:04.455 --> 00:16:06.715
According to her, she had no choice

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:09.415
but to participate because of her father.

00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:13.245
If so, I still have a chance. Do I not?

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:16.125
I should tell her how I feel right now, then.

00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:17.475
Gosh, hold on.

00:16:17.475 --> 00:16:20.375
There is no time. I need to run to her house and-

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:22.175
I mean,

00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:24.155
if you suddenly visit her,

00:16:24.155 --> 00:16:26.825
Lady Eun Ae would be so flustered.

00:16:26.825 --> 00:16:28.895
If then,

00:16:28.895 --> 00:16:32.675
how can I win her heart?

00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:34.865
Sir Su Gyeom,

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:39.415
don't say you've never courted a woman before...

00:16:45.985 --> 00:16:49.215
I didn't know Jung Su Gyeom
was such a dating rookie.

00:16:49.215 --> 00:16:52.375
The ones who look normal on the outside

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.335
usually have hidden flaws.

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:56.525
My Lady.

00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:02.125
Please buy one.

00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:08.865
What's all this?

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:11.295
They are jewelry I made.

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:13.145
They bring good luck.

00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:15.455
Come on.

00:17:15.455 --> 00:17:17.795
It is true.

00:17:17.795 --> 00:17:21.595
I am taking a very important test right now.

00:17:21.595 --> 00:17:24.565
Is there one that would let me pass?

00:17:25.765 --> 00:17:27.045
This one.

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:30.285
You will definitely pass with this.

00:17:30.285 --> 00:17:32.635
Really?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:35.625
This looks prettier to me.

00:17:36.975 --> 00:17:38.515
That is called Hoshinok.

00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.795
It protects you and prolongs your lifespan.

00:17:40.795 --> 00:17:43.305
Oh, I see.

00:17:43.305 --> 00:17:46.125
How about this one, then?

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.145
That is called Inyeonok.

00:17:48.145 --> 00:17:50.825
It connects you with the one you love

00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:54.185
and it lets you two overcome hardship together.

00:17:54.185 --> 00:17:57.615
Oh, wow...

00:17:57.615 --> 00:18:00.525
You have a lot of impressive stuff.

00:18:01.525 --> 00:18:04.475
Inyeonok needs to be purchased as a pair.

00:18:04.475 --> 00:18:06.785
It costs twice as much.

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:09.385
Which one would you like?

00:18:23.965 --> 00:18:26.075
How do you like the tea?

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:30.605
It is unique.

00:18:30.605 --> 00:18:32.035
You cannot get it in this country.

00:18:32.035 --> 00:18:34.865
It is a very rare tea from the Middle East.

00:18:34.865 --> 00:18:38.625
Even Merchant Cho probably cannot get this.

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:43.625
Does the Do family get a lot
of things from overseas?

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.755
Since we have been diplomats for generations,

00:18:45.755 --> 00:18:47.435
we have a lot of connections overseas.

00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:49.095
Once you start looking outside this country,

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:51.275
you find so many fun things all over.

00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:53.605
Fun things, huh?

00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:57.845
I would like to know what those things are.

00:19:00.215 --> 00:19:03.295
Should I show you something fun?

00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:11.545
I am only showing this to you.

00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:15.805
Of course, if we become a family,

00:19:15.805 --> 00:19:18.965
all of this will become yours.

00:19:36.725 --> 00:19:38.885
What a unique symbol.

00:19:38.885 --> 00:19:42.225
Those are rare objects from England.

00:19:42.225 --> 00:19:47.055
I am sure only we own objects with that symbol.

00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:41.205
That is perfect for you.

00:20:41.205 --> 00:20:44.615
Do you pull the trigger like this?

00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:52.845
Pull it.

00:20:52.845 --> 00:20:55.805
Pull the trigger of your heart.

00:20:58.325 --> 00:21:01.185
I am willing to take your bullet.

00:21:27.405 --> 00:21:29.595
I had fun browsing.

00:21:29.595 --> 00:21:31.845
I will leave, then.

00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:33.695
My Lord.

00:21:35.425 --> 00:21:40.015
There is something I want to tell you.

00:21:51.715 --> 00:21:54.225
I want to give this to him quickly.

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:10.095
Burn these clothes immediately.

00:22:10.885 --> 00:22:12.555
Burn these valuable clothes?

00:22:12.555 --> 00:22:15.135
They are just pieces of fabric

00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:17.345
<i>touched by an awful person.</i>

00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:20.585
Oh, yes.

00:22:20.585 --> 00:22:22.905
I will follow your order.

00:22:32.335 --> 00:22:37.625
<i>I do not know how that vixen
Cha Sun Chaek stole your heart,</i>

00:22:37.625 --> 00:22:40.725
but I thought you should know her true side.

00:22:42.655 --> 00:22:45.075
True side?

00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:48.885
The thing is...

00:22:50.005 --> 00:22:54.185
To be honest, you are not the only man

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:57.425
who were intimate with her.

00:22:57.425 --> 00:22:59.345
I heard a Westerner who came to the capital

00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:01.905
recently was intimate with her.

00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:05.735
I heard she even promised
to run away overseas with him.

00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:08.875
She said this country does not
suit her, and it suffocates her.

00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:13.115
She asked him to help her leave
as soon as possible.

00:23:13.115 --> 00:23:15.765
And I can't believe she
participated in the selection.

00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:17.935
Is she not so devious?

00:23:17.935 --> 00:23:22.385
The Cha family has kept her inside for a reason.

00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:24.465
By the way,

00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:26.445
how do you know about that?

00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:29.835
- Pardon?
- You speak as if

00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:34.235
you saw and heard it yourself.

00:23:49.285 --> 00:23:52.985
<i>Actually, that Westerner is from England.</i>

00:23:52.985 --> 00:23:54.805
<i>He told me himself.</i>

00:23:54.805 --> 00:23:57.025
<i>That is how I know for certain.</i>

00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:58.555
[Westerner]

00:24:05.005 --> 00:24:06.055
[Cha Sun Chaek]

00:24:09.255 --> 00:24:11.165
[Cha Sun Chaek]

00:24:27.055 --> 00:24:30.275
<i>She said this country does not
suit her, and it suffocates her.</i>

00:24:30.275 --> 00:24:34.335
<i>She asked him to help her leave
as soon as possible.</i>

00:24:36.715 --> 00:24:38.095
Beautiful day, right?

00:24:38.095 --> 00:24:39.765
Yes.

00:24:54.425 --> 00:24:57.955
How dare she try to frame

00:24:57.955 --> 00:25:01.045
my woman with such nonsense?

00:25:12.254 --> 00:25:14.584
I feel much better.

00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:21.014
Is there something on my face?

00:25:21.014 --> 00:25:22.334
Yes.

00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:24.814
I see emotions in it.

00:25:24.814 --> 00:25:26.804
I have not seen them

00:25:26.804 --> 00:25:29.694
on your face for a long time.

00:25:34.044 --> 00:25:37.044
It is not a bad thing.

00:25:37.044 --> 00:25:41.734
Thanks to Lady Sun Chaek, you have
found different emotions of life again.

00:25:41.734 --> 00:25:44.914
I feel so relieved.

00:25:44.914 --> 00:25:47.264
Don't be silly.

00:25:48.834 --> 00:25:52.354
I will finish things up here. Go in and rest.

00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:54.894
Have a good night.

00:26:01.564 --> 00:26:04.124
<i>Have a good night.</i>

00:26:13.344 --> 00:26:15.284
Good night?

00:26:15.284 --> 00:26:17.834
No such a thing for me...

00:26:25.674 --> 00:26:27.434
I guess I have.

00:26:38.144 --> 00:26:46.204
<i>♫ Just like the moment I first met you ♫</i>

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:50.164

<i>♫ You are all I can see ♫</i>

00:27:09.184 --> 00:27:13.284
<i>♫ The fortune came to me like a dream ♫</i>

00:27:13.284 --> 00:27:15.934
<i>♫ I can give you my everything ♫</i>

<i>♫ That's how beautiful you are ♫</i>

00:27:19.784 --> 00:27:22.384

<i>♫ You looked at me with a shy smile ♫</i>

00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:11.854
Cha Sun Chaek,

00:28:16.204 --> 00:28:17.814
why...

00:28:19.304 --> 00:28:22.024
did you want to meet me?

00:28:22.024 --> 00:28:24.944
Because I like you.

00:28:24.944 --> 00:28:28.074
I've always wanted to fall in love

00:28:28.074 --> 00:28:32.064
with a man like you for once in my life.

00:28:32.064 --> 00:28:35.904
<i>♫ I love you forever ♫</i>

00:28:35.904 --> 00:28:38.454
<i>♫ Don't hide it anymore ♫</i>

00:28:38.454 --> 00:28:43.704
<i>♫ I will show you who I am ♫</i>

00:28:43.704 --> 00:28:47.964
<i>♫ Shall we begin? ♫</i>

00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:08.784
<i>Up until recently,</i>

00:29:08.784 --> 00:29:11.954
<i>she was just one of the women
I crossed paths with.</i>

00:29:11.954 --> 00:29:16.134
<i>But I cannot let her go.</i>

00:29:16.134 --> 00:29:18.664
I must have you.

00:29:18.664 --> 00:29:20.254
No.

00:29:21.254 --> 00:29:23.354
I will have you.

00:29:27.254 --> 00:29:31.674
<i>I will spend my first night with you.</i>

00:30:08.964 --> 00:30:11.174
<i>Even if she got sober</i>

00:30:11.174 --> 00:30:14.134
<i>and does not remember tonight,</i>

00:30:14.994 --> 00:30:19.994
<i>I just need to make her keep falling for me.</i>

00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:25.814
<i>I will devote my last moment to you as well.</i>

00:30:29.004 --> 00:30:30.914
Since that night,

00:30:31.974 --> 00:30:35.284
my nights have been different
than the ones before.

00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:47.324
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:30:51.504 --> 00:30:53.054
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:30:53.054 --> 00:30:54.814
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:30:54.814 --> 00:30:57.674
Huh? Was I mistaken?

00:30:58.664 --> 00:31:00.414
I don't think so.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.864
I miss her.

00:31:18.284 --> 00:31:23.294
Did you find the answer
to the Queen Mother's question?

00:31:23.294 --> 00:31:24.604
<i>Yes.</i>

00:31:24.604 --> 00:31:28.964
Starting with Suk Gyeong of the Jeong family,
the daughter of the royal secretary,

00:31:28.964 --> 00:31:32.654
give the answer you prepared.

00:31:32.654 --> 00:31:36.354
I bought rice seedlings with 10 nyang.

00:31:36.354 --> 00:31:38.244
What would you do...

00:31:38.244 --> 00:31:42.084
if it does not rain after you
planted the seedlings?

00:31:45.514 --> 00:31:48.524
I offered 10 nyang to a temple

00:31:48.524 --> 00:31:51.534
and prayed for the country's well-being.

00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:55.664
Since I prayed and offered with a sincere heart,

00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:58.544
- it is worth more than 10 nyang-
- Next.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:04.794
I bravely went to a gambling house with 10 nyang,

00:32:06.204 --> 00:32:08.754
but I lost all of it.

00:32:08.754 --> 00:32:13.564
So, I learned that I should never gamble

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:16.214
with 10 nyang from now on.

00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:19.334
She's so proud.

00:32:19.334 --> 00:32:20.514
Next.

00:32:20.514 --> 00:32:23.704
I decided to melt the 10 nyang

00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:27.004
you gave to me.

00:32:28.954 --> 00:32:30.744
With the copper from the melted coins,

00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:34.794
I created a one-of-a-kind ring.

00:32:34.794 --> 00:32:37.474
The ring will be handed down over generations.

00:32:37.474 --> 00:32:39.594
I will cherish Queen Mother's

00:32:39.594 --> 00:32:44.324
virtuousness without forgetting
the value of 10 nyang.

00:32:47.764 --> 00:32:50.874
What a sweet gesture.

00:32:53.364 --> 00:32:54.734
Next.

00:32:55.744 --> 00:33:01.744
With 10 nyang, I gave orphans
food and a brush each.

00:33:01.744 --> 00:33:05.924
I think nurturing the talents
of the future is a guaranteed way

00:33:05.924 --> 00:33:10.024
to enrich the country and secure its well-being.

00:33:10.024 --> 00:33:11.664
However,

00:33:11.664 --> 00:33:16.344
can you guarantee the children
would turn out the way you want?

00:33:19.224 --> 00:33:20.844
Next.

00:33:20.844 --> 00:33:24.394
Using the 10 nyang you gave me,

00:33:24.394 --> 00:33:26.284
I borrowed an unused paddy field

00:33:26.284 --> 00:33:29.414
and put catfish and loaches there.

00:33:30.474 --> 00:33:33.064
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:33:35.504 --> 00:33:38.344
<i>Catfish and loaches are natural enemies.</i>

00:33:38.344 --> 00:33:40.154
<i>If you put enemies together,</i>

00:33:40.154 --> 00:33:42.394
<i>their survival instinct strengthens</i>

00:33:42.394 --> 00:33:47.234
<i>and they naturally reproduce
more and get stronger.</i>

00:33:47.234 --> 00:33:51.154
Using that fact, I turned 10 nyang

00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:53.944
into this much.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:59.904
By selling catfish and loaches to
paddy fields with poor harvests,

00:33:59.904 --> 00:34:04.274
I was able to make a lot in a short period of time.

00:34:04.274 --> 00:34:06.514
Some people lament the drought,

00:34:06.514 --> 00:34:09.954
but I wanted to find a new solution
in the midst of that.

00:34:09.954 --> 00:34:12.204
Even empty fields with poor harvests

00:34:12.204 --> 00:34:15.234
can be lucrative if you change your thinking.

00:34:15.234 --> 00:34:20.064
Crises can always be turned into
opportunities. Do you not think so?

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.244
I will announce the final three maidens

00:34:25.244 --> 00:34:28.474
who will advance to the final round.

00:34:29.864 --> 00:34:32.384
The first maiden.

00:34:32.384 --> 00:34:35.234
Right State Minister Do Bae Myeong's daughter,

00:34:35.234 --> 00:34:38.414
Hwa Seon of the Do family.

00:34:42.634 --> 00:34:44.544
Congratulations.

00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:52.944
The next is...

00:34:52.944 --> 00:34:55.924
Scholar Cho Byeong Mu's daughter,

00:34:55.924 --> 00:34:58.944
Eun Ae of the Cho family.

00:35:02.614 --> 00:35:04.574
Good work.

00:35:07.524 --> 00:35:10.634
And the last one is...

00:35:15.104 --> 00:35:17.804
the Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol's daughter,

00:35:17.804 --> 00:35:21.354
Sun Chaek of the Cha family.

00:35:23.494 --> 00:35:27.404
You received the highest score
in the second round.

00:35:28.544 --> 00:35:30.634
Thank you.

00:35:31.504 --> 00:35:32.884
Nonsense.

00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:35.574
How could she win first place?

00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:39.614
The final round, Samgantaek,

00:35:39.614 --> 00:35:44.904
will be held at the Queen Mother's
Palace in two days.

00:35:52.064 --> 00:35:53.834
What's the deal?

00:35:53.834 --> 00:35:56.604
It's my first time winning first place.

00:35:57.694 --> 00:36:01.634
Goodness, I can't believe I used that this way.

00:36:07.384 --> 00:36:10.364
Natural enemies. In Korean, it's "cheonjeok."

00:36:10.364 --> 00:36:12.864
What happens if you put them together?

00:36:12.864 --> 00:36:15.304
You can take catfish and loaches as examples.

00:36:15.304 --> 00:36:18.414
In a paddy field, if you put loaches on one side

00:36:18.414 --> 00:36:21.714
and catfish on the other side
and grow them together,

00:36:21.714 --> 00:36:25.244
the loaches on the catfish side
grow much stronger.

00:36:25.244 --> 00:36:26.724
Why is that?

00:36:26.724 --> 00:36:29.224
To avoid the natural enemy...

00:36:39.734 --> 00:36:43.544
Wow! I cannot believe how fun the selection is.

00:36:43.544 --> 00:36:46.044
The second round was fierce, too.

00:36:47.044 --> 00:36:48.994
D-Did the second round result come out?

00:36:48.994 --> 00:36:50.184
Yes.

00:36:50.184 --> 00:36:52.984
By giving the best answers to the Queen Mother,

00:36:52.984 --> 00:36:54.434
the three maidens were selected.

00:36:54.434 --> 00:36:58.174
I liked Lady Cho Eun Ae's answer the most.

00:36:58.174 --> 00:36:59.784
Yes, her answer was nice.

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:01.894
Which means...

00:37:01.894 --> 00:37:05.834
Lady Eun Ae passed the second round?

00:37:18.264 --> 00:37:20.474
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:37:24.264 --> 00:37:25.974
Hello, Lady Sun Chaek.

00:37:25.974 --> 00:37:28.934
Hello. I'm here to see Prince Gyeongseong.

00:37:28.934 --> 00:37:31.534
He went to bed early.

00:37:31.534 --> 00:37:34.044
The sun hasn't even set yet.

00:37:35.054 --> 00:37:37.254
I just need a moment. Can't you let me?

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:39.274
He'd be thrilled to hear this news.

00:37:39.274 --> 00:37:42.934
I think you should go back home today.

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:10.874
You did such an amazing job today.

00:38:10.874 --> 00:38:13.094
But you look so upset.

00:38:13.094 --> 00:38:17.074
I'm not. I just need to think about something.

00:38:17.074 --> 00:38:20.264
By chance, is it about Prince Gyeongseong?

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:24.414
What are you talking about?
Never. It's not like that, okay?

00:38:24.414 --> 00:38:28.054
What's gotten into you, then?

00:38:30.704 --> 00:38:32.614
After running Madam's errand yesterday,

00:38:32.614 --> 00:38:34.594
I saw Prince Gyeongseong.

00:38:34.594 --> 00:38:36.774
Really? Did he seem busy?

00:38:36.774 --> 00:38:38.804
He looked so tired and mopey, right?

00:38:38.804 --> 00:38:41.034
It's not that.

00:38:41.034 --> 00:38:43.964
Lady Do Hwa Seon and Prince Gyeongseong
were stuck together

00:38:43.964 --> 00:38:45.564
and went inside Lady Do's house.

00:38:45.564 --> 00:38:47.414
Locking arms, even.

00:38:47.414 --> 00:38:49.144
He locked arms with Do Hwa Seon?

00:38:49.144 --> 00:38:52.054
Come on. You must've been mistaken.

00:38:52.054 --> 00:38:56.184
I can recognize people from even 10 ri away.

00:38:56.184 --> 00:38:59.034
I know what I saw.

00:38:59.034 --> 00:39:02.304
But I could not chase them inside her house.

00:39:02.304 --> 00:39:05.244
So, I am just telling you what I saw.

00:39:05.244 --> 00:39:10.034
<i>By chance, was he on his way to see her, too?</i>

00:39:15.214 --> 00:39:18.314
No. I'll just ask him.

00:39:19.344 --> 00:39:22.344
Bang Wool, go to the Hoseondang now

00:39:22.344 --> 00:39:25.624
and tell the servant there that
I will come by early in the morning.

00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:28.254
So, Prince Gyeongseong must
see me before he leaves.

00:39:28.254 --> 00:39:29.434
A-All right...

00:39:29.434 --> 00:39:31.144
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:39:36.394 --> 00:39:38.694
Father.

00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:43.934
Father, please talk to the Queen Mother.

00:39:43.934 --> 00:39:47.134
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong has feelings for me.

00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:48.734
My hard work finally paid off and

00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:50.714
Prince Gyeongseong opened up to me.

00:39:50.714 --> 00:39:53.054
Is that not a relief, then?

00:39:53.054 --> 00:39:55.514
Father, things are going so well.

00:39:55.514 --> 00:39:58.264
It would be so humiliating
if I failed to be selected.

00:39:58.264 --> 00:40:00.194
The final round is still ahead.

00:40:00.194 --> 00:40:01.484
Trust the Queen Mother.

00:40:01.484 --> 00:40:04.934
No. We need to take action while he is interested.

00:40:04.934 --> 00:40:06.594
We cannot delay this. Please?

00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:07.804
Do something, Father.

00:40:07.804 --> 00:40:09.244
All right, I will.

00:40:09.244 --> 00:40:10.544
You mean it, right?

00:40:10.544 --> 00:40:12.684
I said I will, did I not?

00:40:17.994 --> 00:40:19.624
Maiden Eun Ae.

00:40:20.764 --> 00:40:23.784
What brings you here?

00:40:23.784 --> 00:40:26.414
I was waiting for you.

00:40:42.894 --> 00:40:44.624
Maiden Eun Ae,

00:40:45.934 --> 00:40:48.004
It will not be good...

00:40:49.084 --> 00:40:51.664
to do this here.

00:40:51.664 --> 00:40:53.774
Sir,

00:40:53.774 --> 00:40:57.764
you put me in a tricky position
if you come by without notice.

00:40:57.764 --> 00:40:59.714
You know I am participating in the selection.

00:40:59.714 --> 00:41:01.794
I do, but...

00:41:06.644 --> 00:41:08.544
At the Seonmun Club meeting,

00:41:08.544 --> 00:41:12.794
you said you would grant me a wish
if I drank your penalty drink for you.

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.664
I did.

00:41:15.664 --> 00:41:18.464
I will tell you my wish now.

00:41:21.144 --> 00:41:24.354
Stay away from me for a while.

00:41:25.874 --> 00:41:27.954
What do you mean-

00:41:27.954 --> 00:41:31.794
I need to do well in the selection
to obey my father.

00:41:31.794 --> 00:41:35.124
Can you not quit the selection?

00:41:35.124 --> 00:41:38.064
I cannot go against my father's wish.

00:41:38.064 --> 00:41:41.524
If I get caught seeing you privately
during the selection,

00:41:41.524 --> 00:41:44.224
things would get very difficult for me.

00:41:56.724 --> 00:42:00.474
I do know how you feel, Sir.

00:42:00.474 --> 00:42:03.204
If you do not mind,

00:42:03.204 --> 00:42:06.924
could you wait for me for just a little while?

00:42:16.504 --> 00:42:18.364
Gosh, it must be her.

00:42:18.364 --> 00:42:20.534
She filled a rice paddy with fish?

00:42:20.534 --> 00:42:22.874
Why did I just hear about her?

00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:26.074
What a pretty lady.

00:42:39.864 --> 00:42:44.044
Oh, yes. It's me.

00:42:51.144 --> 00:42:53.624
She has not come in a while.

00:42:53.624 --> 00:42:55.934
Did she forget me already?

00:42:57.694 --> 00:43:02.054
Anyway, I wonder if her wish came true.

00:43:04.294 --> 00:43:06.244
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:12.904
You came, My Lady.

00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:15.944
Is Prince Gyeongseong up and about?

00:43:17.914 --> 00:43:20.074
What is it? Is he not up yet?

00:43:20.074 --> 00:43:21.874
No, the thing is...

00:43:21.874 --> 00:43:24.504
I relayed your message to him,

00:43:24.504 --> 00:43:26.274
but when I went inside a moment ago,

00:43:26.274 --> 00:43:28.154
he was already gone.

00:43:28.154 --> 00:43:29.944
Where did he go off to?

00:43:29.944 --> 00:43:32.324
I do not know, either.

00:43:32.324 --> 00:43:34.564
My apologies, My Lady.

00:43:37.424 --> 00:43:39.064
What's going on?

00:43:39.064 --> 00:43:41.274
Is he treating me like a fish he already caught?

00:43:41.274 --> 00:43:42.524
My Lady!

00:43:42.524 --> 00:43:44.384
Lady Sun Chaek!

00:43:44.384 --> 00:43:48.126
- My Lady, there is no time for this now.
- What is it?

00:43:48.126 --> 00:43:50.674
I was told the final round is happening today.

00:43:50.674 --> 00:43:52.364
You need to prepare to enter the Palace now.

00:43:52.364 --> 00:43:53.904
What?

00:43:55.524 --> 00:43:58.484
Bang Wool, make me look the best in Hanyang

00:43:58.484 --> 00:44:00.854
so no one looks better than me.

00:44:00.854 --> 00:44:04.084
I thought you were all about being frugal lately.

00:44:04.084 --> 00:44:07.574
No. I no longer need to be frugal.

00:44:07.574 --> 00:44:09.274
I'll shine brighter than anyone.

00:44:09.274 --> 00:44:11.854
Like the female lead.

00:44:11.854 --> 00:44:15.334
The final round starts!

00:44:19.614 --> 00:44:21.934
The theme of the final round...

00:44:21.934 --> 00:44:24.004
is virtue.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.580
Do not be so nervous.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.350
You have worked so hard.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:42.600
I will treat you to some tea.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.000
Do you have a flower you want to resemble?

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.960
I like peonies.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.500
I-I...

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.110
like lotus flowers.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.940
They grow in the mud,

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.600
but they blossom without

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.700
getting dirty at all.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.280
I want to be like gossypiums.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.270
No matter how beautiful other flowers are,

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:43.310
they only blossom for a season.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:48.320
But gossypiums become the
people's clothes and blankets.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.440
They are the most beautiful flowers in the world.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:46:00.420
To be honest, I was never
so interested in flowers.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.430
But I recently learned about trumpet vine flowers.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.680
I was touched the moment I learned its meaning.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.110
Just like the trumpet vine flowers,
I want to overcome

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.710
hardships such as heat and torrential rain

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.960
and blossom for everyone to see.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.080
Yes.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.990
Hardships?

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:35.350
If your husband faces hardships,

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:40.520
what would be your priority as a wife?

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.320
I think my priority is to be disciplined

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.230
based on the elders' judgment and wisdom

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:48.240
when times are tough.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.520
I will believe that I would learn
from the hardship

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:56.230
and quietly endure until it passes.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:01.450
I think not going through hardships is the best.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:07.030
But if you have no choice but to face it,

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:11.440
I think physical and financial
strengths are most needed.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.940
Women should step up to overcome, too.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:18.100
To do that, not only physical strength

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.670
but an emergency fund would be needed, too.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.310
I think women should be

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:26.570
interested in finances, not just housework.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.700
You say financial strength is important?

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.000
Was it Sun Chaek of the Cha family?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.430
Yes, Your Highness.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.940
Is that why you dressed so lavishly
while the country is

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.560
suffering due to poor harvests?

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.460
As if you are showing off your family's wealth?

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.360
I just wanted to impress you today.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.160
She gets so many silk garments made that

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.330
the fabric shop's threshold is wearing out.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.130
You're much worse than me-

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:16.750
At least, I do not make clothes for some man.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.960
A man?

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.720
Your Highness, for the dignity
of the royal family,

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.920
I need to tell you exactly what I saw and heard.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.330
They say the Chief State Minister's
daughter displayed-

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:35.340
I mean, displayed affection
with a Westerner in the streets.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.040
A Westerner?

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.340
I hesitate to even speak of it.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.630
I can't believe such an immoral woman
participated in the selection.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.430
Even I feel ashamed of it.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.300
Is that true?

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.620
She is slandering me.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.740
I just helped someone in need.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.600
There is a witness.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.100
Witness?

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.890
Tell her what you saw and heard.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.700
She brought a Westerner and

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:13.370
asked me to make clothes for him.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:17.030
I wanted to get him new clothes
because his clothes were too worn out.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.450
Tell her more.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.040
She held hands with him, hugged him,

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.920
a-and I think I saw them k-kissing, too.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.340
No way.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.120
Why would you tell such a lie?

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.230
She did that in public.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.400
Imagine how devious she must be in private.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.730
Is that not obvious?

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:37.850
Do not speak so rudely.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.860
Your Highness, this is not true.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.770
Can you prove that it is a lie?

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:42.910
You don't think I can?

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:45.500
You are disgracing the Queen
Mother's Palace. How shameless.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.240
Stop!

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.840
A royal woman has to be faithful and pure.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.580
Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol's
daughter, Cha Sun Chaek

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.000
will be eliminated from the selection-

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.110
<i>No, My Lord! You cannot!</i>

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.900
Is this the Westerner you mentioned?

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.340
Y-Yes, yes.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.950
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:27.260
What are you doing right now?

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.780
At this man's residence,

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:32.340
I discovered this.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.380
This substance he brought from overseas

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:08.070
makes you show the plague symptoms.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:10.100
And...

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:15.020
Lady Cha right here experienced those symptoms.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.060
I'm sorry!

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.280
- Ma'am!
- Yes.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.800
Another bowl, please.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.030
Same order?

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:30.940
Yes. Add a lot of meat, please.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.060
Okay, got it.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.970
If so,

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:38.830
I almost died...

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.010
because of this Westerner...

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:47.880
I-If so, you should go to the Ministry of Justice.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:52.370
How dare you cause a scene in front of me?

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.600
That Westerner knows the Do family very well.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.480
And the fact that...

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.980
your favorite Do Hwa Seon hired the Westerner.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.410
Do you want that to be revealed?

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.000
If you stop the selection process,

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.280
I will not reveal who was behind this.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.440
Otherwise, we will have to hear his confession.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.430
Speak and tell the truth yourself.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.250
If so, you might be able to live.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.750
Does this symbol not look familiar?

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.650
Your Highness. Your Highness!

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.250
My gosh! My gosh...

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.970
Oh, no...

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:32.180
Massage her arms.

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.390
Your Highness.

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:36.050
Your Highness.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.740
- Your Highness.
- Keep massaging her.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.230
Her feet. Her feet.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:43.750
Your Highness. Your Highness.

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.790
Gosh, what is going on?

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:52.750
Since the Queen Mother lost consciousness,

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.980
His Majesty became furious.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:00.740
Therefore, he ordered the
selection process to stop.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.740
The Westerner was such a dangerous person.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.800
I can't believe it.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.220
That is why you should not open up to anyone.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:22.370
I will not allow you to eat, walk,
or go sightseeing

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:26.190
at all without me.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.390
Have you been gone because
you've been chasing the Westerner?

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.470
I heard you locked arms with Do Hwa Seon, too.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.230
You completely forgot about me, didn't you?

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:58.320
I have never let you go, even for a moment.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.260
I realized something.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.710
To be honest, I...

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.510
Prince Gyeongsong!

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:26.910
His Majesty wishes to see you.

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.970
Do you have to leave again?

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.350
Yes.

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.730
I really hate waiting.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:39.530
But there's no choice.

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:41.680
I'll be waiting patiently.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.300
I will be back soon.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.640
Wait here without going anywhere.

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:57.350
Yes, Obsessive Tyrant.

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:14.100
Please hurry.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.080
Let us go.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.540
He said he'd be back soon.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.160

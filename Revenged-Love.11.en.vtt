00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.960
(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.840
(Episode 11, Come on,
Let's Go Home and Get Registered)

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.080
Dr. Jiang, how many boxes
of aspirin do we need?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.040
Three.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Three boxes.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.920
There are only three days left...

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.600
until the ultimatum
Chi Cheng gave me.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.480
What should I do?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640
Dr. Jiang.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.600
It's been a while, Dr. Jiang.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.200
Aren't you going
to pursue someone else?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
Why did you still come here?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.960
If I'm pursuing someone else,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.160
shouldn't you feel glad?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280
I am.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.560
Don't I look happy?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.320
Don't I?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.640
Dr. Jiang.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.880
How can someone like you...

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.880
be someone's teacher?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.720
Doctor.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040
What's wrong?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.519
She said
she doesn't want to live anymore.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.560
Treat her.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.399
- Where are you going?
- Chubby!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.600
- Get the first-aid kit.
- Okay.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.800
- Cheng Yu, come and help me.
- Okay.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.199
Let's go.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200
Don't go.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Hurry.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.120
You can both go first.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.399
I'll stay here.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.320
Okay. I'll get going then.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560
Bye.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.280
If her root problem isn't solved,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.200
it's useless for you
to stay here either.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.040
If I don't watch over her,
it's the same as not saving her.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
You should go home first.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120
I'm fine.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.400
(The message was sent,
but was rejected by the other party)

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.359
You're awake.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.440
Why did he do that to me?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.719
Why?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.920
Calm down first.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.800
Here. Let me see.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.040
- Let go!
- What are you doing?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040
Let go.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.240
Give it to me.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.400
What's wrong?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.320
Xiao Shuai, are you all right?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760
Xiao Shuai.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.839
- What exactly do you want?
- Cheng Yu, don't act this way.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.920
Let her die.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.080
She's doing this over a guy.
Does she deserve to live?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.880
Because of playboys like you,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.279
those who take
relationships seriously...

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.600
lose the courage to love themselves.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Xiao Shuai.

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.840
I was speaking up for you.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.680
Are you okay?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.279
Calm down.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.239
I'm sorry.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.160
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- It's okay.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.160
I know it was an accident.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.840
Lie down and rest.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.760
Don't think too much first.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's all right.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600
Get some rest.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400
Xiao Shuai.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040
Xiao Shuai.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.160
Xiao Shuai.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.080
Let me treat your wound first.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.919
I'm a doctor.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120
I can do it myself.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.040
It's inconvenient for you
to do it yourself.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.120
Let me do it.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.120
Come on. Be careful.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Slowly.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.879
It might hurt a little.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.280
Bear with it a bit.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840
Does it hurt?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520
I'll be gentle then.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.480
Earlier,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.840
didn't you leave?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280
I did.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.720
I ran some errands,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.120
then I came back.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.760
It's late.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.880
What errands could you have?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.400
Didn't Wu Suo Wei tell me...

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.920
to pursue someone else?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.520
I went out to see...

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.760
if there's anyone suitable.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640
Forget it.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.880
I'll do it myself.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.720
Okay.

00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:02.760
So...

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.880
you don't like that idea.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
It's okay.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.640
I'll think of another one for you.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400
Endure it a bit.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.480
Dr. Jiang, I'm going home.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.360
Thank you so much
for taking care of me.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.000
Xiao Zhuang.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.200
You must love yourself more.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.279
Call me if you need anything.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.560
(Xiao Zhuang)

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
What are you doing?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.200
Get to the point.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.640
I've come up...

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.280
with a perfect, new plan.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.520
Do you want to hear it?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.920
What is it?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.120
- Hello?
- Da Wei.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.919
I have good news for you.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.200
It will definitely make you happy.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.120
What is it?

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.999
Chi Cheng's Snake Lord...

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.760
is coming back to the country
in three days.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.880
His flight lands at midnight.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.720
After that, we'll be free.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.920
Snake Lord?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
What Snake Lord?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.040
Which Snake Lord
do you think I'm talking about?

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.960
The one Chi Cheng
has been missing for six years.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
And for his sake,

00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:38.879
he was willing to turn
against Guo Cheng Yu.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.960
The handsome Mr. Wang.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.040
So what if he's coming back?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.559
What do you think?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.400
If his original lover is back,
he'll have no time for us.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.839
If that's the case,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.560
Chi Cheng
will lose interest in you...

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.440
and won't bother me too.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.080
Guo Cheng Yu had a thing
with him before.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.239
Maybe after he seduces Guo Cheng Yu,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.800
I'll be completely free.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.960
It's killing three birds
with one stone.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.760
When else can you get
something as great as this?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.080
It's not bad.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.080
Da Wei, tell me. Aren't we lucky?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360
Yes.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.080
I have a patient here.
I'll get back to work.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400
Bye.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560
Done.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.440
You know what? My boyfriend
got back together with his ex.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.719
It's okay.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.599
I'll find you a better one, okay?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.560
No, I just want him!

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.680
Mr. Wu.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.160
Let's get back to work first.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.360
Come on.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.280
Mr. Wu.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.640
Mr. Wu.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.000
What's wrong?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.680
I've checked this contract
with Legal Affairs.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.280
Do you have any questions?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320
No.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.560
I was thinking
about something else just now.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.960
Isn't Chi Cheng
the one checking this contract?

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.800
Why did you come to me this time?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.919
I don't know
where Mr. Chi is these days.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920
I can't reach him.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360
Here.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.880
These are loquats from my hometown.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.160
Share them with our colleagues.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640
Okay.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.480
(Chi Cheng)

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200
Chi Cheng.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.960
I've been waiting for so long.
I'm going to kill you, jerk!

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.760
You were freaking cheated on...

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.520
and you're still being a fool,
waiting there.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.759
What did you tell me before?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.760
You were so ruthless.

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.400
You said when he comes back,
you were going to kill him.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.000
Now that he's back,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.160
you're sucking up to him.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.440
Darn it.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.200
(Chi Cheng)

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.040
I'm here to see Er Bao.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.800
Yes. That's what I'll say.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280
Where's Chi Cheng?

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.440
He ended his lease.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.240
When?

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320
Just a couple of days before.

00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:01.399
Why did he end his lease?

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.960
Isn't it obvious?
He's from a rich family.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.840
He just wants to stay here
for a change...

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.080
and experience life.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.880
After a while,
who can stand living here?

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.000
"Experience life"?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.960
You've experienced it for six years.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840
You could stand it at first,
but now you can't.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.240
Poor Er Bao...

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.919
for being with a heartbreaker
like you.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.440
I should've stolen
the snake back then.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.519
What? What did you say?

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.520
Nothing.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.200
It's already the last day.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960
You're here.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.240
Looks like it's going to work today.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.320
I can use reverse psychology now.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.040
Da Wei, how's it going?

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800
Pretty good.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.200
Good times are coming.
Let's go out for a meal.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.440
We really need to celebrate.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920
What's wrong?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.200
In the past few days, Chi Cheng...

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.960
really didn't bother you?

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400
No.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.159
At first, I was worried...

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.559
Chi Cheng would change his mind
halfway through.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.320
After talking to Guo Cheng Yu,
I realized...

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.560
that we were worrying for nothing.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.720
What did you two talk about?

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.960
What else?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.200
About the three of them.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600
I realized...

00:15:30.601 --> 00:15:32.440
that I'm becoming
more interested in Wang Shuo.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.240
Before, I only thought
he was handsome and top-notch.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.880
Now, I realized...

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.320
he's a heartthrob.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.800
And he's very talented.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.280
He's good at all Chinese
and Western instruments.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.200
He held a concert in high school.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.120
He even wrote a song for Chi Cheng.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.200
And he's very fit.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.280
He's a top-ranked national athlete.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.679
Isn't that exaggerated?

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.800
No.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.959
Guo Cheng Yu slept with him once...

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.840
and he's been reminiscing
about it for six years.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.680
Let alone Chi Cheng...

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.880
who were with him for three years.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.400
He'll reminisce about it
for the rest of his life.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.960
Who can get rid...

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.760
of such a deep cancer.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160
Can you?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.160
You can't.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.280
Look at your small frame.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.640
It's obvious that you can't.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.400
I don't even want to get rid of it.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.319
Yes.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.160
And he's very bold.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.639
He dared to sleep
with another man...

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.000
behind Chi Cheng's back.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.000
Do you dare to do that?
I'm sure you don't.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.280
You don't even dare
to sleep with Chi Cheng,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.280
let alone betray him.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.480
That's because I don't like him.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600
Yes.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.200
You don't like him.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.039
I'm just joking with you.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.080
Why are you so mad?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360
Mad?

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.399
Who's mad?
How can you say that I'm mad?

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.280
Look. You're getting angrier.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.680
Da Wei.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.440
You look pale.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240
What's wrong?

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.760
Is there something on your mind?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.560
I'm too excited.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.439
Da Bao.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.840
Anyone can be mad at me,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.280
but not you.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.960
Because when you're angry,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.200
I'll be anxious.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.520
Even if you don't do anything,

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.480
I'll still like you.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.800
I promise.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.760
In the future,
I won't let you get hurt again.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.000
You're just my little loser.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.080
I'm mesmerized by your loser aura.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.760
Liar.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.400
You're such a liar.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.880
It's already 11pm.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.640
Only one more hour...

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.880
before you reconcile with the man
you love but can't have.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.000
After another hour,

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.920
we'll have nothing to do
with each other, Chi Cheng.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.040
Hang in there.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.200
With this slight breeze,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.520
tomorrow will be
another beautiful day.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560
What time is it?

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.800
Darn it. Why isn't it midnight yet?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.560
He's a heartthrob.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.760
And he's very talented.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.200
He's good at all Chinese
and Western instruments.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.079
Guo Cheng Yu slept with him once...

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.080
and he's been reminiscing
about it for six years.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.600
Let alone Chi Cheng.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.600
I used to fantasize
about being with him forever.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.520
If his original lover is back,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.880
Chi Cheng will lose interest in you.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.999
I don't care if you can
write songs or not.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.239
I don't care if you're bold!
I don't care if you're fit!

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240
He's mine now.

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.719
You're mine now!

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.160
Get lost as far as you can!

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.880
I thought you wouldn't show up
until 11:59pm.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.160
Looks like I overestimated
your willpower.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.640
You're mine.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240
I'm yours.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.960
Then you can't sleep
with him from now on.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.840
I won't sleep with him.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480
Only with you.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.800
Then from now on,

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.000
when you're with me,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.320
don't think about him.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800
Don't worry.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.520
Why would I think about him?

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.640
I'm warning you.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.319
That's all his own business.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.879
No matter how talented he is,
it's his business.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.159
From now on, you'll only hear
my clear singing voice.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.360
No matter how fit he is,
it's still his business.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.440
You shouldn't be concerned
about his body.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.280
You should be concerned about
the wound on my neck and chest.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.240
I don't care if he's bold.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.399
Don't use his integrity
as a standard...

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.120
and treat my self-respect...

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.400
as nothing.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.280
Jiang Xiao Shuai is really good
at making things up.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800
All right.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.360
I told you. I'm yours.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.040
Are you mine then?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.600
Of course.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240
Fine.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.960
Since you're mine,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.840
shouldn't we get a certificate?

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.840
In this society, it's really hard
if you don't have a certificate.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Think about it.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.840
If you don't have
a certificate with me,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.200
who will you complain to
if I run away one day?

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.360
If you run away,

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.520
I'll find someone else
to get a certificate with.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.320
Who the heck dares to steal my man?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
What?

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.080
What are you doing?

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.999
I'm at a friend's house.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.040
That Snake Lord's flight lands
at midnight in three days.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.200
I'm busy.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.719
If you're not free to come home now,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.759
I'll make time tomorrow...

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.880
to tear down your stupid
art installation company.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
- Come on.
- Wait for me.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Let's continue with the certificate.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.400
I have to go home.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.880
My dad called me.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160
Was it really your dad?

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.360
It really was.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.400
Since your dad is calling you
at this hour,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600
it must be urgent.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600
Go.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.480
Do you think it's easy for me
to wait for this day?

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.440
Wait for me to come back.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160
Young Master Guo.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.400
Do you think Chi Cheng succeeded?

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.120
He scared Jiang Xiao Shuai so much.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.240
How can I easily let him succeed?

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.960
Ask to meet Wu Suo Wei.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.560
Tell him...

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.360
it's to discuss a collaboration.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480
Where?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640
Shengshi Club.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.039
That's intense.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.960
(Shengshi Club)

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.080
- Don't be shy.
- Young Master Guo.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840
Xiao Tian.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.120
Behave yourself.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.880
I'm here to talk business.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.760
Do you come here often?

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.920
Not as often as Chi Cheng.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.560
Let's go.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.599
By the way, Young Master Chi
hasn't been here for a long time.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.960
What has he been up to lately?
I miss him so much.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520
We're here.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520
Come on.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.639
Accompany him well today, guys.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.000
- Okay.
- Sure!

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.639
I need to take this call.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640
Have fun.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.080
You're straight, right?

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.280
Yes.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.880
Does Chi Cheng come here often?

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.000
For a period of time,
he came here every day.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.600
He even stayed the night.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480
What does he do here?

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.240
What do you think?

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.320
Could he really...

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.280
come here to sing and dance?

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.920
Mr. Chi likes hardcore things.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.880
When you entered, did you notice
the second room by the door?

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.639
As soon as Mr. Chi enters it,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.999
the room is filled
with cries and moans.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.520
He's so into it.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.840
Did he pick you many times?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.360
I'm the one he picks the most.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.160
He says I'm obedient.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.680
He can torture me...

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.000
however he wants.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.919
Look.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.240
Look at this cigarette burn.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.920
Young Master Chi did it.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.999
Why are you leaving?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.720
Something came up at work.
I have to go.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.239
Come on. Let's have fun!

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240
Let's have fun!

00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:45.360
Let's have fun!

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.320
He hasn't shown up all day.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.560
He didn't contact me either.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.280
He must have completed the mission.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.320
Please bless me.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.560
Please let it be successful.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
Please.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.200
I'm so mad.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.000
What's wrong? What happened?

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.640
I accidentally entered
Chi Cheng's den of lust.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.960
The male escort told me
all about his dirty secrets.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.760
Now, I want to destroy him.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.440
Isn't it too late
for you to find out now?

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.080
Didn't you already sleep
with Chi Cheng yesterday?

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.440
Almost.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.640
If his dad
didn't call him home urgently,

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.800
I'd regret that to death.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.320
Why would I sleep with him?

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.040
He's lucky if I don't break up
with him.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440
It's over.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.240
All my efforts are in vain.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920
Why are you here?

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.200
Is there anyone else at your home?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.520
No. Why?

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.840
Can I hide here
for a couple of days?

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.280
Please.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.000
You can hide here forever.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.560
If you say that,
I'll get going then.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640
Don't go.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.560
Then...

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.520
what about the clinic?

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.160
This is good for me.
I can rest for a couple of days.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.480
Rest?

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.240
This place...

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.080
is most suitable for resting.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520
Let's go.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I'll be gentle.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.040
He has a private doctor at home.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.080
Why does he keep coming
to my clinic then?

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.000
Take a look.
What do you want to eat?

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.280
I'll make it for you.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.400
Where have you been?

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.400
I haven't been able to reach you
since last night.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.480
Can't you hear me?

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720
Don't touch me.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.679
What does this mean?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.800
I think you're dirty.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.640
- What?
- I said,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.840
I think...

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.400
you're dirty.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.879
You think I'm dirty?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.479
Yes, Shengshi Club's
No. 6 male escort, Xiao Tian,

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.760
asked me to tell you...

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.320
that he misses you.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.280
Did you have to go there
to investigate me?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.760
I don't know
how many people I've slept with.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.440
I used to be this dirty.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.080
It's not too late
for you to regret it now.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.239
If I regret it,
would I have scolded you?

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.519
What's wrong
with scolding you a bit?

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.600
For the little dirty things you did,
shouldn't I scold you?

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.200
I'm unhappy.
I just want to say it out loud.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.560
I think you're dirty.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.400
I think you're dirty.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.640
Are you and Wu Suo Wei...

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.160
still together?

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840
What do you mean?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.320
Do you want us to break up?

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.080
No. I just see that
you're not in a good mood.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.880
He won't let me touch him.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760
Why?

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.120
He...

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.560
thinks I'm dirty.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.880
How dare he think...

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.440
that you're...

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.560
Why?

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.440
He dug up my dirty secrets.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.240
Isn't this karma?

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.040
What?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.760
Say that again.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.600
I didn't say anything.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.680
Pull over at the pharmacy.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800
What's the matter?

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.960
Get me some medicine.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440
What medicine?

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.840
Something that can
freaking decrease my libido.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.920
This won't do.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.680
I have to think of something.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.920
Size 80.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.000
Size 82.1.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520
This is...

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.800
Xiao Tian.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.599
Chi Cheng and I have arrived
Shengshi Club.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.840
- When are you coming?
- Shengshi Club?

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.799
I'm sorry. I sent it by mistake.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.880
He sent it by mistake?

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160
Darn it.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.440
He went there again.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.800
I knew he wouldn't be able
to endure it.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.000
That perverted mutt!

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.320
I'm going to kill him!

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.200
Mr. Chi.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.520
Didn't you say
a client wants to see me...

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.040
to order some art installations?

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.160
Why did you bring me here?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.759
The client will be here soon.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.880
Let's have some fun first.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.480
Young Master Chi,
you're finally here.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.200
Get lost.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.560
Young Master Chi, he kicked me.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280
Young Master Chi.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.320
I'll spank him when we get home.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.680
Listen up, everyone!

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.399
From now on,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.720
we will bid this place
farewell forever.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.200
I'm sorry for not supporting
your business anymore.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.959
Who wants to see him?

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.320
Take a good look.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400
Once he's out of this door,

00:34:35.401 --> 00:34:37.080
you won't get the chance
to look at him again.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.840
What does this mean?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.240
Let's go home and get a certificate.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.000
It's really worrying when you go out
without a certificate nowadays.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760
Where are we?

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.200
My new home.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.360
However...

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.400
It's going to be
your new home soon too,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.680
my little master.

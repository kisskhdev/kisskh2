WEBVTT

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.759
Another verbal thank you, huh?

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.839
Can't you give a more practical reward?

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:19.519
Who says I can't?

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.119
What are you doing?

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:35.520
This is your reward.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.039
Don't overthink it.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.119
I'm fair with rewards and punishments.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.880
I just don't want to owe you a favor.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:43.840
I'm not overthinking.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.479
I was just thinking, since you're so fair,

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.439
can you give me the reward for collecting the debt last time too?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.679
How should I reward you?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.320
I have a face too, you know.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.320
Keep dreaming.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.159
Why did An'an just pass out?

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.640
Don't tell me that's all she can drink.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.560
Fifteen, twenty.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.479
Ten, twenty.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.680
Stop talking, come on.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.519
Drink.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.439
My head hurts so much.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.879
Who told you to drink so much yesterday?

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.840
No one could stop you.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840
Stop drinking that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.040
Drink this honey water.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.920
Wasn't that to help you vent your anger?

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.319
That Gao Qing even said you were marrying up.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.719
I can't stand hearing that.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.280
They're siblings, after all.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:32.480
It's normal for a younger sister to speak up for her brother.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.519
But I really didn't expect this.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.560
What's written in these documents is actually true.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.359
Could it be that we were just overthinking it?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.599
Yeah.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480
Could it be that Gao Xing is just an ordinary person?

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.879
The facts are right in front of us.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.400
We have no choice but to believe it.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.480
Then how do we explain what happened before?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.560
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.519
Maybe it was luck.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.359
I still can't figure it out.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.480
Alright, let's not think about it for now.

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.120
Now the company has funding.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.560
And we have the Immortal Doctor's secret recipe.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.479
Let's focus and get ready for the next new product.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.240
Okay.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.639
What are you doing here?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.919
Qingyan, after all, I am your fourth uncle.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.680
All these years, I've worked diligently at Qingmu.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.919
Even if I haven't made great contributions, I've at least worked hard for the company.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.520
You can't just fire me like this.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.120
What you've done is illegal.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.919
Do you know that?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.719
I know, I know.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.319
If it weren't for the fact that you're my fourth uncle,

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.479
I would have called the police long ago.

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.080
I'm giving you the chance to resign yourself.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.400
It's to let you keep some dignity.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:13.479
Get out.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.280
Qingyan.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.039
Get out.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.039
If you don't leave now, I'll call security.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.120
You—

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.560
Oh, President Su,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.680
please don't be angry.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.120
You should think of a solution.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.240
If you get fired,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.680
then I'll be the next one.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.960
What can I do?

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.120
Su Qingyan doesn't even care about my status as her fourth uncle.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.560
She fires people without hesitation.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.240
She's completely cold and heartless.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.759
It's all that kid Gao's fault.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.120
If it weren't for him,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.240
my position as vice president would be secure.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.960
There wouldn't be so many problems.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.360
I have to get revenge for this.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.840
So what are you planning to do?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.960
What to do...

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.280
How...

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.360
Ah!

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:10.759
Ah, darling,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.080
I need your help with this.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.000
Me?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.639
Let's use a honey trap.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.680
That kid Gao only got promoted

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.519
because of Su Qingyan.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.040
You go seduce him.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.759
Invite him to a hotel and drug him.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.160
Then we'll find another woman

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.519
and put the two of them together.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.240
We'll take photos of all their embarrassing moments.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.879
Then send them to the company.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:37.639
By then,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.439
Su Qingyan definitely won't keep him.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.360
And Su Qingyan

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.720
will become the biggest joke in the company.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.079
Director Gao

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.160
Secretary Xu, do you need something?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.680
What, I can't come to you if there's nothing important?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.199
Last time, you were so close with me.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.079
Why are you suddenly so distant?

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.240
I'll get hurt, you know.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.319
Don't be like this.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.079
There are so many people in the company.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.279
It would be awkward if someone saw us.

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.639
So you mean,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.120
it would be more convenient if we went somewhere no one could see us?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.519
The two of us like this

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:45.920
isn't appropriate.

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.480
What's inappropriate about it?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.959
You're the deputy director.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.079
I'm the deputy director's secretary.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.240
If there's work, the secretary handles it.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.279
If there's nothing,

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.879
Director Gao,

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.319
are you free tonight?

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.040
Let's go to a hotel.

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.879
I want to ask for your guidance on work.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.680
Guidance on work, right?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.839
I'm free, of course I'm free.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.120
Then tonight at seven, Yunlan Hotel.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.759
Let's not leave until we meet.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.519
Gao Xing and Xu Qian

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.639
How could that be?

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.560
Did you see it wrong?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.040
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.319
How could I have seen it wrong?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.560
The two of them were flirting in the break room, making eyes at each other.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.439
They even said they were going to get a hotel room tonight.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.879
Get a hotel room?

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.120
That's impossible.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.959
He just recently with me—

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.879
With you?

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.079
Ah.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.399
Ah, it's nothing.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.079
I mean, Gao Xing's taste shouldn't be interested in her, right?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.120
Qing Yan, you really need to be more careful.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.680
Men these days aren't any good.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.240
Xu Qian just has to crook her finger,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.879
and he takes the bait and comes running.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.040
If you don't believe me,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.079
go ask him yourself tonight.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:22.560
See if he'll tell you the truth.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.839
Fine.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
I'll ask him myself.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.439
I'm here.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:48.879
See?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.439
I told you I wasn't lying.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.839
He really did show up for the date.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.480
Let's see what he has to say for himself.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.279
Don't rush, wait a bit longer.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.480
Let's catch him red-handed first.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.839
Gao Xing, you really are something.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.639
You went behind my back and even got handsy with someone else.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.920
And to think I even promised you a reward.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.959
Ugh.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.720
A reward?

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.360
What reward?

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:16.319
Oh.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.160
It's nothing.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:22.040
I mean, guys like him deserve to be struck by lightning.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.759
That's true.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.079
But Qingyan, are you jealous?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.919
No, why would I be jealous?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.039
He and I are just contract spouses.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.039
He can do whatever he wants.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.879
I don't care.

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:47.039
They've left, hurry.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.879
Over there.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.440
Excuse me, please.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.639
Secretary Xu, your outfit tonight...

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.879
...is truly irresistible.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:37.240
Mr. Gao, you're secretly dating her.

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:39.360
If President Su finds out,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.240
won't she be angry?

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:44.759
Su Qingyan is nothing.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.919
Just a little girl.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:49.279
Compared to a beauty like you,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.759
she's not even worthy to carry your shoes.

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.879
Gao Xing is going too far.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.279
It's more than just too far.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.960
It's downright shameless.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.240
I, Su Qingyan, must have been blind to be with—

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.399
Why are you looking at me?

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:09.639
I'm not jealous.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:11.679
The night is short.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.600
Let's get started.

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:19.240
Mr. Gao, don't rush.

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:20.759
It's our first date.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.080
We should build some feelings first.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.679
Come on, let's have a drink first.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.480
This wine...

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.720
...is a bit strong.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.440
There's something even stronger coming up.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:07.120
Wait here for me.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.320
I'll go prepare a surprise for you.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.600
Hurry, hurry!

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.320
Where is he? Where did he go?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.240
So, I already did as you instructed.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.679
I made him drink the wine.

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:38.879
Sit, sit, sit.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:39.440
Sit.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.879
Baby, look.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.639
Gao has already fallen into the trap.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.639
Where are the people you arranged?

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:47.120
Don't worry, they'll be here soon.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:51.679
Gaoxing, explain this to me clearly.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.279
Let go of me! What are you doing?

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:57.759
Don't go.

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.440
There's surveillance.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:01.919
There's surveillance.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:03.679
Your fourth uncle drugged me.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.159
And set up surveillance too.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.080
It's right behind.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.360
It's recording right now.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.279
So what do we do now?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.559
You act with me.

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:15.519
Act?

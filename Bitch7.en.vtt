I really didn't!

Student Baek Jenna,

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.833
we must follow the rules and procedures.

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:27.743
We'll mobilize all our channel
resources to the fullest

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.867
and make the biggest splash.

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.767
You're doing well.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:41.200
Yes, please proceed that way.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.776
I

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.909
Did everything you told me to do,

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.009
and Baek Jenna

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:52.776
ended up exactly as you wanted.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.043
Hm...

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:55.242
So?

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.543
Delete the video.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.743
What video?

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:00.143
Are you pretending not to know?

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.267
Oh, that one?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.443
I don't want to.

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.443
I did everything you asked.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:12.767
You think that's enough?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.667
You should be grateful

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.509
that I'm even looking at you.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.709
So all that talk

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:27.233
about making me your pet
and getting me into Diamond 6

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.367
was just a game to you?

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:36.809
Hey, how old are you?

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.143
Gosh, you're so naive.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:40.676
You actually believed that?

Min Yul Hee!

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.867
Why?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.509
If you act like a pet one more time,

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.443
I'll delete it then.

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.733
Stop crying

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.000

what did I tell you?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.409
Isn't it clear now?

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.876
What suits you

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.667

My doing?

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.176
You can't marry Baek Jenna.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.676
Even if it's Hanmyeong Group,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.700
would your father
accept her into the family?

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:15.676
She might have taken
the medicine unknowingly,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.133
or could have been caught in a trap.

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:21.143

Think carefully.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.276
Why should I do that?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.543
Because you're the one

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:52.309
who has Min Yul Hee's necklace.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.509
That necklace...

Wait for the critical moment.

If you act recklessly,
we'll be the ones to suffer.

This?

Fine.

And once it's sorted,

00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:09.576
I'll go to the police station.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.633
It won't take long.

00:08:13.933 --> 00:08:15.543
Really?

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:19.476
Does that mean everything
will end soon for me?

will be taken into consideration.

engagement ceremony as planned.

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:38.567
I'm grateful to hear you say that.

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:42.143
For business people,

00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:47.309
isn't this level of risk always present?

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:50.009
Thank you for understanding.

00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:51.509
But, well...

00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:53.409
From our perspective,

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:57.343
it's about shouldering the risk
for one person, right?

00:13:57.367 --> 00:14:01.909
Instead of us sharing
the risk for one person,

00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:05.933
we'd like you to show some sincerity.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.176
What do you mean?

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.309
A request to sell Hanmyeong Holdings shares

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:17.033
allocated to Jin Wook's portion.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.743
Given that we're about to become in-laws,

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:26.443
consider this an investment
for the children's future.

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.676
You should think of it that way.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.276
The investment in our Chasel Medic division

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.833
will be handled by Jin Wook.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.776
The engagement ceremony
will proceed as scheduled.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.043
You can take responsibility
for your own words, can't you?

00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:52.809
- Yes.
- This matter

00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:55.176
must not fail under any circumstances.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.976
Hearing that I'm bringing in
a drug-addict daughter-in-law

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.809
isn't a solution, you know?

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.009
I understand.

00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:04.876
I will

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.967
resolve it without fail.

00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:19.343
Call her.

00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:21.167
Now.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.600
Who is this?

00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:31.533
What?

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.133
Can you let me stay

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:37.743
just for one night?

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:39.600
Come in.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.476
It's cancer.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.567
By the time I realized, it was too late.

00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:16.043
You should have told me
if you brought in a friend.

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:18.043
- Huh?
- Here.

00:16:18.067 --> 00:16:20.509
When did you buy this?

00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:22.309
The floor is warm?

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:24.609
- You're not cold?
- No, not at all.

00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:27.076
I will make breakfast in the morning,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.376
so eat with your friend before leaving.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.043
I'm fine.

00:16:30.067 --> 00:16:32.109
I don't usually eat breakfast.

00:16:32.133 --> 00:16:33.709
She will not eat. Just leave.

00:16:33.733 --> 00:16:37.343
Alright? Then I'll crank up the boiler,

00:16:37.367 --> 00:16:38.743
so sleep comfortably.

00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:39.809
Yes.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:42.476
Thank you for your concern.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.076
Your friend is so kind and polite.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.709
Oh, so sweet.

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:49.776
Dad!

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.867
She's not nice.

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:55.143
- Get out.
- Yeah, okay.

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:57.100
Thanks.

00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:02.543
For my dad, strawberries
are the best treat.

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:05.543
He's really treating you as special.

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.076
Do you like strawberries?

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.976
My mom

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.143
only craved strawberries
when she was pregnant with me.

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:15.676
But I guess he couldn't buy them often.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.367
My mom likes strawberries too.

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.909
Wait, you're not going home?

00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:27.543
Can't you tell by looking?

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:28.676
That's why I came here.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.900
Have you eaten?

00:17:37.233 --> 00:17:39.377
I'll make ramyeon.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.176
But have you

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.809
ever tried things like ramyeon before?

00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:46.676
Are you crazy?

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.700
I thought people like you
didn't eat stuff like ramyeon.

00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:28.933
Die, you wretch!

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.843
Who the hell are you!

00:18:35.867 --> 00:18:37.509
Mess with her again and you're dead.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:39.100
Get lost!

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.943
This is stalking.

00:18:55.967 --> 00:18:59.243
I've recorded all your
sneaky following around.

00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:02.300
Leave voluntarily if you don't
want police to be involved.

00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:08.600
Ah, darn it!

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.200
Hye In, are you okay?

00:19:22.033 --> 00:19:24.309
When I brought you home last time,

00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:25.943
I saw Hwang Bo Seok.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:28.143
I thought that might be the case.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.500
I had no idea at all.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.609
Thanks.

00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:36.376
Just in case, I'll come
tomorrow morning too.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.909
No, I have someone to go with tomorrow.

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:41.643
I really appreciate your help.

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:44.176
Get home safe.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.176
Okay.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.509
You go in first.

00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:49.833
I want to see you go inside.

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:53.967
I'll go then.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.043
Are you asleep?

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:30.867
No.

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:39.567
How should I live from now on?

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.009
You see me like this and still say that?

00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:49.543
I just

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:52.900
wish someone would
tell me the right answer.

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:56.509
What good are answers others give you?

00:20:56.533 --> 00:21:00.609
People like you don't need that.

00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:03.567
Your environment is different from mine.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.743
What we can never have,

00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:12.209
you already have everything.

00:21:12.233 --> 00:21:16.667
Why do you keep thinking people
like us are special or different?

00:21:17.533 --> 00:21:20.576
On the surface, it may seem that way.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.543
Just because we have money doesn't
mean we lack worries or loneliness.

00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:26.743
Everyone lives the same way.

00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:29.843
Eat, shit, repeat...

00:21:29.867 --> 00:21:32.433
But still...

00:21:34.167 --> 00:21:36.076
Everyone's lives are similar.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.933
It's just how they live that's different.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.576
But, you

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.709
didn't do drugs, right?

00:21:44.733 --> 00:21:45.843
Are you crazy?

00:21:45.867 --> 00:21:48.776
Ha Min Hee must've switched it.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.333
Then what about the drugs in your locker?

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.867
Min Yul Hee probably ordered it.

00:22:00.533 --> 00:22:02.143
But...

00:22:02.167 --> 00:22:03.733
What?

00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:07.609
Never mind.

00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:10.043
What? You stopped mid-sentence.

00:22:10.067 --> 00:22:14.200
Stopping mid-sentence is your habit?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.043
I

00:22:18.067 --> 00:22:20.676
Saw Min Yul Hee and Cha Jin Wook kissing.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.443
- At school.
- What?

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:23.643
They kissed?

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:25.509
Min Yul Hee dragged him down,

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:28.633
and Cha Jin Wook seems
to be trying something too.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.133
Let them do as they please.

00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:56.409
I

00:22:56.433 --> 00:22:59.076
Am going to get engaged to
Cha Jin Wook of Chasel Medic.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.876
What?

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.276
What about Woo Jin?

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.076
I don't know. I'll break
off the engagement.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.976
Min Yul Hee, do you think
you can decide that on your own?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.676
Plus, Hanmyeong's Baek Jenna is there.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.743
I'm the one who ruined Baek Jenna.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.009
That's why I'm trying to get
engaged to Cha Jin Wook.

00:23:16.033 --> 00:23:18.700
Mom, just help me find a dress.

00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:21.743
Why?

00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:23.676
Honestly, compared to Park Woo Jin's hotel,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.267
Chasel Medic is better.

00:23:30.267 --> 00:23:33.843
You know how your mom
and dad got married, right?

00:23:33.867 --> 00:23:36.443
When you see something good,
you have to claim it fast.

00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:39.133
Otherwise, someone else will take it.

00:23:39.967 --> 00:23:41.867
Are you confident?

00:23:46.467 --> 00:23:48.276
A few days ago,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.376
when you bumped into me under the overpass,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.667
what were you doing there?

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:57.200
Oh, that?

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:00.833
I'll tell you later.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.309
That day, Oh Si Eun's phone

00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:07.243
was snatched by someone.

00:24:07.267 --> 00:24:08.876
What?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.476
Who?

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.933
It's not certain yet,

00:24:14.167 --> 00:24:15.709
but I think it's Park Woo Jin.

00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:17.567
Park Woo Jin?

00:24:18.967 --> 00:24:21.509
Why him?

00:24:21.533 --> 00:24:23.343
He seems to be the culprit

00:24:23.367 --> 00:24:25.009
in Oh Si Eun's case.

00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:26.867
What?

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.500
What a psycho!

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:32.809
But,

00:24:32.833 --> 00:24:35.167
what can you possibly do?

00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:37.643
We have to fight.

00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:41.233
Everything I have is at stake here.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.776
Hey, we need to go this way.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.967
You go ahead. I have somewhere else to be.

00:24:59.233 --> 00:25:01.067
Hey!

00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:03.376
Back in the day,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.543
I used to wonder why you guys
never wore coats or paddings.

00:25:08.567 --> 00:25:11.676
You just never needed to wear them,

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.109
because you're always riding in cars

00:25:14.133 --> 00:25:17.100
and only going places without cold winds.

00:25:19.233 --> 00:25:21.476
But you'll need it now.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.900
Don't throw it away.
Give it back to me later.

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:43.901
[~~ Onorisque]

00:25:46.033 --> 00:25:48.100
You're here.

00:25:49.167 --> 00:25:51.800
Gosh, I was just about to call you.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.709
But what's with these clothes?

00:25:57.733 --> 00:25:59.576
This isn't your style.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.276
Someone gave them to me.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.009
Who?

00:26:04.033 --> 00:26:05.676
Jin Wook?

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.533
No.

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.509
Should we go eat?

00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:12.600
Let's get something delicious.

00:26:16.133 --> 00:26:17.909
Mom,

00:26:17.933 --> 00:26:19.900
I didn't do it.

00:26:21.533 --> 00:26:23.367
You know that, right?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.733
I know.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.043
My daughter would never do that.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:39.476
Dad also

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.543
said no one would believe that nonsense.

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:44.876
I know.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.809
I am worried

00:26:46.833 --> 00:26:49.143
you might be struggling.

00:26:49.167 --> 00:26:51.533
That's my concern.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.209
Mom,

00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:57.643
can I

00:26:57.667 --> 00:26:59.967
sleep here tonight?

00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:03.943
Ugh, you'll be uncomfortable.

00:27:03.967 --> 00:27:05.509
No.

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:07.443
It's not uncomfortable.

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:09.367
Is that so?

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.309
Cha Jin Wook,

00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:39.633
this isn't manners, right?

00:27:43.933 --> 00:27:45.643
<i>I replaced the medicine</i>

00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:48.709
<i>in the lady's pill case as you requested.</i>

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:50.276
Well done, Secretary Hong.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.243
The money will be split and
deposited into that account.

00:27:53.267 --> 00:27:55.743
If Miss Jenna leaves the country,

00:27:55.767 --> 00:27:57.743
I might not be able to return.

00:27:57.767 --> 00:27:59.976
That would be really problematic for me.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.176
Secretary Hong,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.533
if you worry too much, you'll grow old.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.476
If there's no proper position to return to,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.143
I'll call you as my secretary
depending on the situation.

00:28:18.167 --> 00:28:20.176
Don't worry about that,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.967
so just rest quietly and thoroughly.

00:28:28.467 --> 00:28:30.943
There are many eyes watching.

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:33.267
Let's go somewhere quiet

00:28:33.933 --> 00:28:36.033
and have a talk.

00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:40.209
Baek Jenna's drug case

00:28:40.233 --> 00:28:42.843
should be concluded now.

00:28:42.867 --> 00:28:46.900
If you handle it immediately, I'll
delete the recording file for you.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.443
End it quietly with
Secretary Hong's confession.

00:28:51.467 --> 00:28:53.276
That seems better.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.676
Even if you make a big deal out
of it, if it turns into a mud fight,

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.443
Hanmyeong and Chasel,

00:28:57.467 --> 00:28:59.176
both will stagger.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.409
You worked hard to get here,

00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:04.276
but as someone's wife,

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.676
you should remain here.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.676
But how do you know
Secretary Hong will come out?

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.333
She is trash, even recorded it.

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:16.776
Don't worry too much about that.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.509
Secretary Hong is a first-time
offender, so at most 3 years.

00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:22.643
After release, she'll work
at our welfare foundation.

00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:26.576
Secretary Hong's father
is lying in a hospital.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.600
Chasel will provide lifelong care.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.376
You didn't bypass the
superiors for nothing.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.300
Later, our son should learn with you too.

00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:57.843
Mom!

00:29:57.867 --> 00:30:00.367
This is from the bagel shop you like.

00:30:04.233 --> 00:30:06.033
Hello?

00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:10.676
I just heard from Jin Wook

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.676
about the engagement ceremony.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.309
I was about to mention that too.

00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:17.133
It's okay.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.009
When Jenna wears the dress,

00:30:20.033 --> 00:30:23.309
she'll look so pretty.

00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.743
Right, Jin Wook?

00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:26.700
Exactly.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.543
Jin Wook,

00:30:28.567 --> 00:30:30.343
you hesitated for a second.

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:32.676
No, that's not it...

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.909
She'll look pre...

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:37.909
- Yes...
- Oh, it's a joke.

00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:39.176
No, but

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.743
aren't you late for school?

00:30:41.767 --> 00:30:43.976
It's okay during the
special admissions period.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.643
Oh, I see.

00:30:45.667 --> 00:30:47.709
But, Mother,

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:49.409
I have an external
interview scheduled today,

00:30:49.433 --> 00:30:50.876
so I should get going first.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.309
Alright.

00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:54.167
Okay.

00:30:57.567 --> 00:31:00.376
Have a good time with your mom.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.709
Hm, and

00:31:02.733 --> 00:31:05.143
seeing you with your hair tied up,

00:31:05.167 --> 00:31:07.100
you look really pretty.

00:31:18.633 --> 00:31:20.776
Cha Jin Wook,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.643
what the hell are you up to?

00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:23.776
What?

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.409
I like your mother,

00:31:25.433 --> 00:31:27.309
because she's like a mother to me.

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:28.476
That's all.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.209
What's your real identity?

00:31:30.233 --> 00:31:32.033
Me?

00:31:34.333 --> 00:31:37.343
<i>Madam told me to do it. I had no choice.</i>

00:31:37.367 --> 00:31:39.833
<i>I needed the money too.</i>

00:31:41.033 --> 00:31:42.043
<i>But,</i>

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:45.309
<i>I didn't want to go this
far with Miss Jenna.</i>

00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:48.343
<i>Actually, unlike Jenna's appearance,</i>

00:31:48.367 --> 00:31:51.100
<i>she's a fragile girl with many scars.</i>

00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:54.309
<i>I've watched her since elementary school.</i>

00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:56.267
<i>But,</i>

00:31:58.233 --> 00:32:00.933
<i>I did something terrible.</i>

The person marrying you?

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:15.433
There's a tactic in chess called 'windmill'.

00:32:15.457 --> 00:32:18.590
The best one at that...

[Cheongdam International High School]

What's going on?

Black hoodie.

00:33:11.133 --> 00:33:13.767
The wrist injury you mentioned.

00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:19.243
It's Park Woo Jin!

00:33:19.267 --> 00:33:21.009
What?

00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:22.943

- [Park Woo Jin: Are you hiding that phone well?
- [Black Dog]

00:33:24.133 --> 00:33:26.143
We'll pretend to be Black Dog

00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:28.367
to lure Park Woo Jin out.

00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:33.167
I'm sending it.

00:33:40.633 --> 00:33:42.376
- Will he come?
- Of course, 100%.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.476
When you sent me a
text like this, I went out too.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.976
This is a bit scary though.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.033
But I'm curious.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.167

WEBVTT

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.480
Gaoxing, once we go, there's no turning back.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.039
If you still have any secrets,

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.879
it's not too late to tell us now.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:29.320
You're overthinking it.

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.280
I'm just an ordinary person.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.320
What secrets could I possibly have?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.520
So calm.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.759
Doesn't seem like he's lying to us.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.000
No rush. You'll know once we get there.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.119
Hello, Mom.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.520
We're already on our way.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.159
Make a nice dinner tonight.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.119
Okay, son.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.640
I'll have dinner ready and wait for you.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:05.159
This is today's new script.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.480
Everyone, memorize your lines quickly.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.280
Do your best later.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.840
Once we're done,

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:15.439
everyone will get paid.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:16.560
Okay.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.680
Nightingale, you've worked hard lately.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.680
This task,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.239
let me handle it.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.280
You?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.159
Yeah, since the boss is so interested,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.920
I'll join in and play along too.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840
Then you'd better hold back a little.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.040
Don't mess things up for the boss.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.359
Don't worry.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:42.920
Leave it to me.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.079
We're here. This is my hometown.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.079
This is Qingshui Village.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.079
It's the countryside, so it's a bit rundown.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.439
Can't compare to the big city.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.280
If you're not used to it,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
It's still not too late to go back now.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.319
No need, since we're already here.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.879
There's no reason to turn back halfway.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.240
Let's go, let's take a look.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.879
This kid, Xiao Gao,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.120
has been sensible since he was little.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.639
As soon as he learned to walk,

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.840
bare-bottomed,

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.439
he already knew to come help out at home.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.400
Having such a considerate and responsible kid as a husband

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.080
is really your good fortune, girl.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.319
Xiao Gao has been smart since he was young.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.280
He studies hard and is exceptionally talented.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.919
Back then, I already thought

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.879
this boy would definitely make something of himself.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.919
He's truly extraordinary.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.560
Whoever marries him

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.080
is sure to have a good life.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.560
Xiao Gao, this kid

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.280
Ah

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.360
No, I mean Brother Gaoxing

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.639
He's always been especially nice to us since we were little

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.840
He was the leader of the kids in our area

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.639
All the girls in our village used to say

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.479
They wanted to marry him when they grew up

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.319
Brother Gaoxing

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.919
Which of these two sisters is your wife?

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.080
Silly, only kids make choices

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.240
Of course Brother Gaoxing wants them all

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.919
Don't talk nonsense

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.560
Go play, you two

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.879
Kids say the darndest things

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.159
Kids say the darndest things

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:10.759
I didn't expect that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.879
People in your village think highly of you

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.439
Can't help it, our village is just simple and honest

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.960
Everyone likes to speak the truth

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.439
It's getting late

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.599
There's food made at home

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
Let's go back and see my parents

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.879
Okay, lead the way

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.400
Dad

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.719
Mom

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.520
I'm back!

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.560
Gaoxing is back!

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.000
You're back!

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.199
Come in quickly.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.280
Which one of these two is it?

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.840
Su Qingyan, your daughter-in-law.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.680
Oh, okay.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.719
This is her best friend.

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.159
A bonus, buy one get one free.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.719
Who's the "buy one get one free"?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.879
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.280
Why call us Uncle and Auntie?

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.479
Just like Gaoxing.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.199
Just call us Mom and Dad.

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.759
Mom, Dad.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.879
Yes, yes, good.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.560
Such a beautiful girl

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.719
is actually our family's daughter-in-law.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.520
Gaoxing,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.120
you're really lucky.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.080
Well,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.159
everyone must be hungry.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.039
Your mom and I will go bring out the food.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.399
Go on, go on, go on.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.959
Let's go, let's go.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.639
Let's go, let's go.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.480
Your parents are really warm and welcoming.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.519
Of course they are.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.639
When they heard you were coming,

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.279
they got up early to start cooking.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.959
You're really from Qingshui Village?

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.879
Everything in the documents is true.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.639
What else would it be?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.240
Are you doubting me?

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.279
Sorry about that.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.040
Actually, we originally came here to...

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.839
Honey.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:48.600
Honey

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.360
Honey

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.079
Honey

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.439
Honey, you're finally back.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.240
You were working in the city,

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.279
leaving me all alone at home.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.040
I missed you so much.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.639
Happy

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.480
Explain to me clearly who she is.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.439
Her?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.639
I'm his wife. Who are you two?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.120
What a joke.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.160
If you're his wife, then what does that make our Qingyan?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.480
What does she have to do with me?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.800
Honey

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.079
How did you go out and come back with two women?

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.560
If you keep this up, I'll get jealous.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.519
Alright, happy.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.639
I was about to say I misunderstood you.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.839
I didn't expect you to have a wife here.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.160
No wonder you kept making excuses not to bring us back.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.639
So you were hiding a woman here all along.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.839
Mr. Gao, do you have anything else to say?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.879
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240
You two wait for me a moment.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.680
I asked Nightingale to find someone to put on an act.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.800
Why are you making things more complicated?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.439
I just thought this was a rare opportunity.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.240
So I wanted to have some fun too. How was my performance?

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.839
You’re something else, Gao.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.519
Right in front of Qingyan,

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.720
you’re still flirting with another woman.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.879
Have you no shame?

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.040
An’an, let’s go.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.480
Honey,

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.399
you’ve misunderstood.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.240
She’s my sister.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.639
She was just joking with you.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.120
Sister.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.240
She’s the real deal.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.160
Absolutely genuine.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.560
My biological sister.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.000
Why are you just standing there?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.360
Hurry up and help me wrap this up.

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:13.399
I can help.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.759
But I want a raise.

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.759
Fifty percent.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.639
Taking advantage of the situation, huh?

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.800
Thirty percent at most.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.319
Forget it, then.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.600
I’ll just keep pretending to be your wife.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.920
Qingyan, look!

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.279
Those two shameless people

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.279
are still flirting and getting handsy.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.120
They’re really treating us like fools.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.639
Let’s go.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.879
Honey!

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.560
You drive a hard bargain.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.160
Fifty percent it is.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.560
You're generous, boss.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.959
Deal.

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:47.959
Sister-in-law, I was just joking with you.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.000
My name is Gao Qing.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.079
My brother is right.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.279
I really am his sister.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.759
You two

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.439
are really siblings?

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:55.759
Of course.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.680
Really.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:57.959
Truer than gold.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.600
The food is here!

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.040
Qingqing, you're back.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.199
Hurry, hurry, set the table, it's time to eat.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.240
Sister-in-law, come eat.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.319
Come on.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.079
Qingyan, try this.

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.639
Eat more.

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.399
Thank you, Mom.

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:19.399
We're all family.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.680
No need to thank me.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.920
Our Gao Xing has a simple nature.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.199
He's very honest.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.399
In the future, as you live together,

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.800
please be more understanding.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.279
Simple-minded

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.000
Very honest

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.000
Are you talking about him?

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.000
My brother is quietly talented.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.439
Don’t be fooled by his ordinary appearance.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800
In fact,

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:43.600
his abilities are beyond what you can imagine.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.199
Sister-in-law,

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.000
you’ll be really lucky after marrying my brother.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.800
It’s unimaginable.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.079
This delivery guy

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.800
probably makes several thousand a month.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.600
Unlike our Qingyan,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.959
who started a company at such a young age.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.879
As for her net worth,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.879
it’s just

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.160
a few hundred million.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.680
A few hundred million—is that a lot?

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.600
Not much, but it’s better than delivering food.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.959
Oh, you probably don’t know.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:13.560
Someone like our Qingyan,

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.160
in all of Yuncheng,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.839
all the outstanding young men

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.600
are waiting for her to choose them.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.079
Marrying your brother so early

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.000
is really marrying beneath her.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.560
Oh, then you probably don’t know either.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.600
My brother’s admirers

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.800
line up from here all the way to England.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.800
Even the British princess

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.799
cries and begs to marry my brother.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.039
She’d have to change her nationality first

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.279
and then line up at the counter for a number.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.440
A female CEO marrying my brother

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:43.480
is really marrying up.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.600
Who are you saying is marrying up?

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.679
Who are you saying is marrying beneath themselves?

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:47.159
Alright, alright, stop arguing.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.480
Let’s eat, let’s eat.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.240
How about we open a bottle of wine?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.519
Let's all have a drink.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:53.440
Oh, no, no.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.799
I don't drink alcohol.

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.200
I'm driving, so I can't drink.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:58.039
If they won't drink, we will.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.559
Meeting Qingqing today,

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.960
it feels like we've known each other forever.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:03.399
We have to have a drink.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.879
Qingqing, you're not scared, are you?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.639
An'an, you're joking.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:09.399
It's rare for me to be in such a good mood.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:13.480
As your big sister, I'll keep you company to the end.

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:21.840
How's it going downstairs?

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.799
An'an and your sister are having a drinking contest.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.200
The two of them are really getting into it.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.159
My sister is spoiled.

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.120
Please don't mind her.

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:31.679
Of course not.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.600
Actually, we were the ones being presumptuous.

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:35.799
We came over without letting them know first.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.440
But your uncle and aunt are really nice.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.879
Of course, they're professionals.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.399
Ah.

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:43.600
What do you mean?

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:47.399
It's nothing.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:50.759
I just meant the environment here is pretty simple.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.960
As long as you don't mind.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.240
Not at all, I actually like it here.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.879
It's warm and peaceful.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:58.080
The people are honest and kind.

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.480
It's not like our Yun City.

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:02.440
Every day is just work and scheming against others.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.399
By the way, about the skincare products last time—

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.000
I haven't properly thanked you yet.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.480
Just another verbal thank you?

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.559
Can't you give me a real reward for once?

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.480
Who says I don't have one?

[The child actors were filmed safely.]

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.687
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:23.767
The result of the selection
that the Queen Mother pushed for

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.937
was her passing out?

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.247
I... I should have seen that.

00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:34.727
I should have seen that.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:47.437
So, how is the Queen Mother feeling now?

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:10.387
<i>That Westerner knows the Do family very well.</i>

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:12.877
<i>If you stop the selection process,</i>

00:01:12.877 --> 00:01:15.617
<i>I will not reveal who was behind this.</i>

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:18.667
How did Prince Gyeongseong find out?

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:22.907
He sure is something else.

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:27.867
Since the selection was canceled as he wanted,

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.977
he probably will not threaten me anymore.

00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:36.227
The Queen Mother and a Westerner?

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:40.237
What does she need to hide by

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:43.317
risking humiliation like that?

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:50.327
Bring in Prince Gyeongseong now.

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:56.447
Prince Gyeongsong!

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:02.537
His Majesty wishes to see you.

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:07.577
Do you have to leave again?

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:08.907
Yes.

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:13.327
I really hate waiting.

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:15.097
But there's no choice.

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:17.247
I'll be waiting patiently.

00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:19.837
I will be back soon.

00:02:19.837 --> 00:02:23.257
Wait here without going anywhere.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:32.957
Yes, Obsessive Tyrant.

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:57.137
I hear there was a commotion
at the Queen Mother's Palace today.

00:02:57.137 --> 00:02:59.597
She planned this selection...

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:02.857
since she treasures you so much.

00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:06.127
But you behaved rudely there.

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:09.297
You went too far this time.

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:10.837
My apologies, Your Majesty.

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:16.707
Why did you drag the Westerner
to the Queen Mother's Palace?

00:03:32.017 --> 00:03:34.447
She never leaves the Palace.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:37.607
There is no way she met a Westerner.

00:03:37.607 --> 00:03:39.547
If so,

00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:43.627
was the Do family who does business often

00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:46.277
with foreign countries involved in this?

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:57.447
Is Do Bae Myeong's family
plotting something secretly?

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.677
Tell me.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:04.217
Right now.

00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:08.287
It was just a trivial commotion.

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:12.137
It is nothing
you should worry about, Your Majesty.

00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:13.997
Trivial...

00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:18.317
T-Trivial... trivial...

00:04:18.317 --> 00:04:20.277
Because it is trivial,

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:24.617
you will not report it to me?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:30.837
Because I know how loyal you have been,

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:35.967
I ordered your wedding to be
considered a royal wedding,

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:39.207
but I do not think...

00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:45.087
you are ready to start a family.

00:04:50.627 --> 00:04:54.327
Therefore, delay the wedding.

00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:58.857
And behave cautiously and be reflective for now.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.877
I cannot do that.

00:05:04.857 --> 00:05:06.787
What did you just say?

00:05:06.787 --> 00:05:10.417
Let me take care of my own wedding.

00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:17.927
Let you...

00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:21.527
take care of your wedding?

00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:29.067
Yes, yes.

00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:36.587
You voiced your opinion for the first time.

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:40.517
There must be a reason for it.

00:05:43.407 --> 00:05:45.967
Do not get me wrong.

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:52.457
I am just worried you would be criticized.

00:05:53.827 --> 00:05:57.687
I will not cause you any harm.

00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:06.077
[Episode 7: Inflection point in the story]

00:08:14.147 --> 00:08:15.897
Cha Sun Chaek.

00:08:15.897 --> 00:08:19.407
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

00:08:19.407 --> 00:08:22.257
Are you really okay?

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:25.297
I'm okay.

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.887
I was so afraid that

00:08:47.097 --> 00:08:49.487
I might never see you again.

00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:57.147
I should not have left you alone.

00:09:01.077 --> 00:09:02.897
I am sorry.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.977
It is not your fault.

00:09:08.427 --> 00:09:11.017
You saved me.

00:09:39.727 --> 00:09:42.277
When I was drowning,

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.227
I thought I would actually die.

00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:50.607
But in that moment,

00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:57.747
I thought of you, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:10:04.607 --> 00:10:07.357
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:10.327
I was so afraid.

00:10:27.447 --> 00:10:28.917
I...

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:33.887
love you.

00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:34.347
Cha Sun Chaek,

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:36.617
I want you to...

00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:40.117
swear on your confession earlier.

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.217
Swear?

00:11:46.187 --> 00:11:49.007
Swear on the moon and the stars

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:51.137
and kiss me.

00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:56.367
If that's what you want, I can do it all night.

00:12:00.757 --> 00:12:03.977
Would you be able to handle it?

00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:30.277
<i>At first, I thought he couldn't be mine.</i>

00:12:30.277 --> 00:12:33.697
<i>Your smile, eyes,</i>

00:12:33.697 --> 00:12:36.287
<i>and even your voice.</i>

00:12:37.817 --> 00:12:41.127
<i>If they belonged to someone else but me...</i>

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:43.347
<i>I don't even want to imagine it.</i>

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:50.967

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:54.767

00:12:54.767 --> 00:13:04.867
<i>♫ I smile whenever I look in your eyes ♫</i>

<i>♫ My heart belongs to only you ♫</i>

00:13:19.837 --> 00:13:26.847
<i>♫ You came into my heart ♫</i>

<i>♫ You let me smile again ♫</i>

00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:33.467
<i>You are not drunk tonight, are you?</i>

00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:39.407
<i>As you can tell, I'm totally clear-headed.</i>

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:45.437
<i>Smile a bit, Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:47.737
<i>Smile a bit.</i>

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:55.987
<i>What did you think of me when you first met me?</i>

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:01.837
<i>You seemed very unstable.</i>

00:14:02.807 --> 00:14:04.497
<i>Is that all?</i>

00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:08.497
<i>And you were very beautiful.</i>

00:14:17.497 --> 00:14:21.827
They must be planning to stay up all night.

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:26.067
Will she have babies
as a wedding gift at this rate?

00:14:36.747 --> 00:14:39.427
Give me a break. Seriously.

00:14:43.207 --> 00:14:46.847
Why is the night so endless?

00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:49.097
I feel lonely.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:11.147
My Lady, calm down!

00:15:12.597 --> 00:15:15.147
How dare you tell me to calm down?

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.137
Do you think I am a joke, too?

00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:19.837
Get out. Get lost!

00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:36.987
<i>Does this symbol not look familiar?</i>

00:15:36.987 --> 00:15:38.637
No...

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:40.267
No.

00:15:41.987 --> 00:15:43.867
I did not do it.

00:15:44.637 --> 00:15:46.817
No one can find out.

00:15:46.817 --> 00:15:49.077
N-No one.

00:16:13.857 --> 00:16:16.147
F-Father.

00:16:16.147 --> 00:16:17.857
I heard about what happened.

00:16:17.857 --> 00:16:19.227
I-I...

00:16:19.227 --> 00:16:21.627
Buying a fake nobility note

00:16:21.627 --> 00:16:25.617
cannot change one's fate, I suppose.

00:16:55.907 --> 00:16:59.387
My Lady, I purchased everything you ordered

00:16:59.387 --> 00:17:01.547
to get for the children.

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:08.627
I have not visited them in a while.

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:12.767
I will visit them soon.
Please pack them up well for me.

00:17:29.627 --> 00:17:33.167
<i>Wake up, Your Highness.</i>

00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:31.127
Prince Gyeongseong, we need to get up.

00:18:31.127 --> 00:18:33.377
Just a couple more hours.

00:18:50.137 --> 00:18:53.577
Come on. Let go, I said.

00:18:56.977 --> 00:18:59.037
Have you already changed your mind?

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:01.297
It's not that.

00:19:02.757 --> 00:19:07.007
I also have a solution, then.

00:19:17.587 --> 00:19:20.147
<i>How about now? How about now?</i>

00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:24.217
<i>- Come on
- No, no!</i>

00:19:24.217 --> 00:19:25.967
<i>Stay still.</i>

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.837
<i>Don't touch me! Seriously.</i>

00:19:27.837 --> 00:19:29.367
Come on.

00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:31.677
Please, please! Move!

00:19:31.677 --> 00:19:33.297
- Please...
- Come on.

00:19:45.997 --> 00:19:48.007
- Are you hungry?
- Are you hungry?

00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:50.517
Well...

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:59.737
Today, I'm the chef at Hoseondang.

00:21:31.202 --> 00:21:34.822
Here's Cha Sun Chaek's Hoseondang breakfast.

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:36.852
Hoseondang breakfast?

00:21:36.852 --> 00:21:39.832
It's simple, and it has
all the essential nutrients.

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:41.382
And it's pretty to look at.

00:21:41.382 --> 00:21:44.362
It's the perfect breakfast.

00:21:44.362 --> 00:21:46.682
You could have made the servants cook.

00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:49.472
To be honest, one of the things I've wanted to do

00:21:49.472 --> 00:21:52.802
was having a hotel breakfast during a staycation.

00:21:52.802 --> 00:21:56.952
Think of this as a hanok hotel suite.

00:21:56.952 --> 00:22:00.172
Only I know what the breakfast is like.

00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:02.582
Come on and try it.

00:22:04.202 --> 00:22:06.042
Here.

00:22:07.042 --> 00:22:08.992
Say, ah.

00:22:13.372 --> 00:22:14.962
How is it?

00:22:16.182 --> 00:22:19.032
I'm sure it tastes amazing

00:22:19.032 --> 00:22:21.522
because I made it with love.

00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:26.312
Look how touched you are.

00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:29.402
Okay, then, try this, too.

00:22:31.562 --> 00:22:34.662
I will eat the rest of it.

00:22:34.662 --> 00:22:36.292
Okay.

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:48.132
I'm so happy to see you enjoying my cooking.

00:22:48.132 --> 00:22:51.952
Should I make you breakfast every day from now on?

00:22:53.532 --> 00:22:55.912
<i>Dear husband...</i>

00:23:02.932 --> 00:23:05.422
Have breakfast.

00:23:05.422 --> 00:23:08.612
It's yukjeon, your favorite.

00:23:08.612 --> 00:23:11.282
Dear, say, ah.

00:23:11.282 --> 00:23:13.652
If you don't finish this,

00:23:13.652 --> 00:23:15.802
I'll be angry.

00:23:28.482 --> 00:23:30.272
This, too.

00:23:33.022 --> 00:23:35.022
It looks tasty.

00:23:35.932 --> 00:23:37.872
Aigoo, seriously.

00:23:37.872 --> 00:23:41.222
What a waste. Look at all this.

00:23:42.372 --> 00:23:44.352
What's wrong with it...

00:23:47.922 --> 00:23:50.422
This is not edible.

00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:55.902
With my skill level,

00:23:55.902 --> 00:24:00.042
I could have a hit breakfast
spot in Hanyang, right?

00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:01.692
Should I make you lunch, too?

00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:05.312
Our country is all about eating three meals a day.

00:24:09.692 --> 00:24:13.082
I hate to interrupt your happy moment,

00:24:13.082 --> 00:24:17.272
but His Excellency is about to punish you.

00:24:17.272 --> 00:24:22.472
If you do not go home now,
he might really lock you up this time.

00:24:22.472 --> 00:24:26.112
Right. I don't think he'd forgive me this time.

00:24:26.112 --> 00:24:28.652
I'm sorry, but I need to go now.

00:24:28.652 --> 00:24:30.622
Eat lunch without me.

00:24:30.622 --> 00:24:32.812
I'm sorry.

00:24:38.322 --> 00:24:39.812
<i>A grown woman...</i>

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:42.162
slept outside again?

00:24:43.642 --> 00:24:46.232
Forgive me, Father.

00:24:48.512 --> 00:24:50.422
Calm down, Your Excellency.

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:54.272
She was staying at Hoseondang safely, at least.

00:24:54.272 --> 00:24:56.532
How is that place safe?

00:24:56.532 --> 00:24:58.642
It is the most dangerous place.

00:24:58.642 --> 00:25:02.212
T-There was a special circumstance yesterday.

00:25:02.212 --> 00:25:07.112
Why do you have special circumstances so often?

00:25:10.672 --> 00:25:13.862
Since we're on the topic, Father...

00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:17.472
I think...

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:23.892
I should get married as soon as possible.

00:25:25.372 --> 00:25:26.882
If I get married and move out,

00:25:26.882 --> 00:25:29.612
I'd no longer be staying out the night.

00:25:30.512 --> 00:25:32.882
I want to get married as soon as possible

00:25:32.882 --> 00:25:35.902
and leave this family.

00:25:41.532 --> 00:25:43.352
Your Excellency.

00:25:43.352 --> 00:25:45.202
Gosh.

00:25:45.202 --> 00:25:46.442
Your Excellency.

00:25:46.442 --> 00:25:51.312
<i>Your Excellency! Madam! Please come out!</i>

00:25:55.272 --> 00:25:56.942
Prince Gyeongseong,

00:25:56.942 --> 00:25:58.892
what brings you here?

00:25:58.892 --> 00:26:00.382
I brought the wedding proposal myself

00:26:00.382 --> 00:26:02.942
because I want to marry your daughter.

00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:06.012
I already said that I am against this marriage.

00:26:06.012 --> 00:26:07.912
Please leave now.

00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:09.572
Father.

00:26:09.572 --> 00:26:12.522
Your Excellency, he is such
an important son-in-law-to-be.

00:26:12.522 --> 00:26:15.732
You cannot kick him out like this.

00:26:15.732 --> 00:26:18.922
Please come inside and have some tea.

00:26:18.922 --> 00:26:21.442
Wife, how is he a son-in-law-to-be?

00:26:21.442 --> 00:26:24.662
Sun Chaek slept outside twice because of you.

00:26:24.662 --> 00:26:26.902
He is not an important guest.

00:26:26.902 --> 00:26:29.762
We should call him a daughter thief.

00:26:33.452 --> 00:26:37.842
I am willing to live with you
as your son-in-law as well.

00:26:40.992 --> 00:26:46.222
Who would refuse to live
with such a dependable son-in-law?

00:26:47.202 --> 00:26:48.972
He means...

00:26:48.972 --> 00:26:51.282
he wants to move in with us?

00:27:25.222 --> 00:27:27.642
Only walk on petals from now on.

00:27:41.782 --> 00:27:43.802
I am against it!

00:27:46.852 --> 00:27:49.422
M-Move in?

00:27:49.422 --> 00:27:52.552
- Get married and leave this family quickly!
- Go on!

00:27:53.502 --> 00:27:56.222
Aigoo...

00:27:56.222 --> 00:27:58.422
- Father!
- Your Excellency.

00:27:58.422 --> 00:28:00.322
Is he feeling ill?

00:28:00.322 --> 00:28:01.782
He is ill due to anger.

00:28:01.782 --> 00:28:05.162
His chest seems to be filled with anger.

00:28:05.162 --> 00:28:07.702
It is about to explode.

00:28:07.702 --> 00:28:09.772
I want all of you gone!

00:28:09.772 --> 00:28:11.872
Father, calm down.

00:28:11.872 --> 00:28:13.662
Go ahead and go inside.

00:28:13.662 --> 00:28:16.012
- My Lady, let us avoid this.
- You are making Father angry.

00:28:16.012 --> 00:28:18.992
I meant you, too!

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:26.952
Aigoo... aigoo...

00:28:41.452 --> 00:28:44.912
You are unbelievable.

00:28:53.042 --> 00:28:55.882
You are the unbelievable one.

00:28:55.882 --> 00:28:58.892
Do you like handsome men that much?

00:28:58.892 --> 00:29:02.192
Is that why you called him a son-in-law-to-be?

00:29:02.202 --> 00:29:07.822
Beauty lasts not just three months but forever.
I still believe that.

00:29:07.822 --> 00:29:14.032
But that is not why I want him as a son-in-law.

00:29:14.032 --> 00:29:15.572
Regardless of your opposition,

00:29:15.572 --> 00:29:19.062
he willfully brought the wedding proposal.

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:22.982
He only shows warmth toward Sun Chaek.

00:29:22.982 --> 00:29:29.642
I wanted to support him for that reason.

00:29:29.642 --> 00:29:33.642
Even so, I will not change my mind.

00:29:35.202 --> 00:29:37.412
Do you not remember?

00:29:37.412 --> 00:29:39.732
When I said I would marry you,

00:29:39.732 --> 00:29:43.582
my parents were so against it.

00:29:45.012 --> 00:29:49.842
Ultimately, no parent can bend their child's will.

00:29:49.842 --> 00:29:52.402
I threatened to shave my head and become a monk.

00:29:52.402 --> 00:29:55.152
I broke my parents' hearts and...

00:29:55.152 --> 00:29:58.392
ended up marrying you.

00:30:03.042 --> 00:30:07.702
You should stop now and approve them.

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:16.672
You just do not know what kind
of person Prince Gyeongseong is.

00:30:21.682 --> 00:30:23.042
Geez.

00:30:26.482 --> 00:30:30.472
Prince Gyeongseong must've been very flustered.

00:30:30.472 --> 00:30:33.292
Gosh, why did Father have to be like that?

00:30:45.712 --> 00:30:49.122
My Lady, I think you caught a cold.

00:30:49.122 --> 00:30:52.852
What happened to you last night?

00:30:58.132 --> 00:30:59.652
<i>Who was the person...</i>

00:30:59.652 --> 00:31:01.962
<i>who pushed me?</i>

00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:05.922
<i>They definitely are resentful of me.</i>

00:31:06.922 --> 00:31:09.652
<i>Does this symbol not look familiar?</i>

00:31:09.652 --> 00:31:12.172
<i>Was it Do Hwa Seon after all?</i>

00:31:13.612 --> 00:31:15.912
I won't tolerate her anymore.

00:31:15.912 --> 00:31:18.722
I'd better settle things this time.

00:31:25.452 --> 00:31:27.462
<i>What brings you here?</i>

00:31:27.462 --> 00:31:31.122
You must know better than I do.

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:33.772
If this is about the other day,
I've heard about it.

00:31:33.772 --> 00:31:36.582
I heard the Westerner we were
caring for caused trouble.

00:31:36.582 --> 00:31:38.282
It's not just any trouble.

00:31:38.282 --> 00:31:39.802
It's serious trouble.

00:31:39.802 --> 00:31:41.972
You are also responsible for opening up to

00:31:41.972 --> 00:31:44.142
a stranger without any doubts.

00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:46.102
How could a nobleman's daughter mingle with

00:31:46.102 --> 00:31:48.002
a stranger without any fear?

00:31:48.002 --> 00:31:51.072
You want to turn it around and blame me?

00:31:51.072 --> 00:31:53.522
That Westerner tried to kill me.

00:31:53.522 --> 00:31:55.352
That is none of my business.

00:31:55.352 --> 00:31:57.422
Just tell me what you want.

00:31:57.422 --> 00:31:59.142
I am happy to compensate you.

00:31:59.142 --> 00:32:00.472
Compensate?

00:32:00.472 --> 00:32:03.772
Can you put a price on a person's life?

00:32:03.772 --> 00:32:06.462
That's not what I want.

00:32:06.462 --> 00:32:11.532
What I really want is your apology.

00:32:11.532 --> 00:32:13.862
A sincere apology.

00:32:22.382 --> 00:32:26.622
<i>The original story changed a long time ago.</i>

00:32:26.622 --> 00:32:29.922
<i>The male lead fell in love with me,
a side character,</i>

00:32:29.922 --> 00:32:32.342
<i>and promised to spend his life with me.</i>

00:32:32.342 --> 00:32:33.852
Lady Sun Chaek.

00:32:33.902 --> 00:32:37.802
<i>And the female lead became my best friend.</i>

00:32:37.832 --> 00:32:39.842
<i>The supporting male character might be</i>

00:32:39.842 --> 00:32:44.482
<i>able to win the female lead's heart as he wanted.</i>

00:32:45.572 --> 00:32:50.502
<i>If so, maybe the villain could change, too.</i>

00:32:53.202 --> 00:32:56.342
Stop acting fake, Cha Sun Chaek.

00:32:56.342 --> 00:32:58.172
You are on your high horse because

00:32:58.172 --> 00:33:00.312
you think you will marry Prince Gyeongseong soon.

00:33:00.402 --> 00:33:04.502
But wait and see if you could be
happy after insulting me like this.

00:33:04.522 --> 00:33:08.782
I didn't tell anyone that you
pushed me into the water.

00:33:08.782 --> 00:33:11.362
Not even Prince Gyeongseong.

00:33:11.362 --> 00:33:13.112
Because I wanted to give you a chance.

00:33:13.112 --> 00:33:16.472
What do you keep rambling on about?

00:33:26.432 --> 00:33:28.752
Wake up, Do Hwa Seon.

00:33:28.752 --> 00:33:31.912
Stop torturing others and live your life.

00:33:31.912 --> 00:33:34.652
If you keep acting like this,

00:33:34.652 --> 00:33:37.082
you might actually die.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:42.942
You think I will die alone?

00:33:42.942 --> 00:33:44.682
Wait and see!

00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:04.602
All right.

00:34:04.602 --> 00:34:06.562
This is a 30-year old

00:34:06.562 --> 00:34:08.862
mountain ginseng wine my father has been hiding.

00:34:08.862 --> 00:34:10.262
You are day drinking?

00:34:10.262 --> 00:34:13.622
Are you that happy the selection was canceled?

00:34:15.822 --> 00:34:17.752
It is not like that.

00:34:17.752 --> 00:34:22.042
To congratulate you for overcoming hardship,

00:34:22.042 --> 00:34:25.072
I wanted to share this precious wine with you.

00:34:26.562 --> 00:34:29.532
Do not drink it with me. Drink it with...

00:34:29.532 --> 00:34:30.842
that maiden instead.

00:34:30.842 --> 00:34:32.882
I wish I could-

00:34:37.432 --> 00:34:39.072
Do you like her that much?

00:34:39.072 --> 00:34:41.842
You must know how I feel.

00:34:41.842 --> 00:34:45.352
She came serendipitously and stole my heart.

00:34:45.352 --> 00:34:47.162
My hunch says she is the one.

00:34:47.162 --> 00:34:50.302
I am desperate not to lose her.

00:34:50.302 --> 00:34:52.352
I have never felt this way before.

00:34:52.352 --> 00:34:56.552
You are experiencing something
for the first time, too.

00:34:56.552 --> 00:34:58.712
You are right.

00:34:58.712 --> 00:35:01.452
We are friends for a reason.

00:35:04.662 --> 00:35:07.412
Friends?

00:35:07.412 --> 00:35:10.852
If so, it is your turn now.

00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:17.422
I know something about this matter.

00:35:18.632 --> 00:35:19.962
Move straight ahead.

00:35:19.962 --> 00:35:22.672
Men are supposed to move straight ahead.

00:35:22.672 --> 00:35:24.502
Straight ahead?

00:35:25.622 --> 00:35:29.972
Yes. It is my turn to take action.

00:35:29.972 --> 00:35:31.672
You are the best, Beon Beon.

00:35:31.672 --> 00:35:33.942
I will do so right away. Straight ahead.

00:35:33.942 --> 00:35:35.652
Straight ahead.

00:35:41.602 --> 00:35:45.552
Anyway, I heard His Majesty scolded you for

00:35:45.552 --> 00:35:48.622
creating a scene at the Queen Mother's Palace.

00:35:54.892 --> 00:35:59.002
There are so many invisible eyes
and ears in the Palace.

00:36:00.572 --> 00:36:02.482
I heard he told you to delay the wedding, too.

00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:04.372
Do you still not know me?

00:36:04.372 --> 00:36:06.722
Once I set my mind to something,

00:36:06.722 --> 00:36:08.202
I make sure to do it.

00:36:08.202 --> 00:36:09.882
That is why I am worried.

00:36:09.882 --> 00:36:12.912
I am worried your relationship
with His Majesty would be ruined.

00:36:14.052 --> 00:36:16.092
From what I hear,

00:36:16.092 --> 00:36:19.892
Yi Gyu, Prince Seonghyeon, is returning soon.

00:36:20.752 --> 00:36:24.782
You never know if Prince Seonghyeon

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:27.042
still resents you.

00:36:29.042 --> 00:36:32.282
<i>You are siding with someone who
killed my father and your mother.</i>

00:36:32.282 --> 00:36:34.662
Do you want to live like an animal?

00:36:36.222 --> 00:36:38.302
I will never forget this day.

00:36:38.302 --> 00:36:41.932
Both you and this disgusting world.

00:37:51.922 --> 00:37:54.292
<i>All right. All right.</i>

00:37:54.292 --> 00:37:57.482
<i>Yes, yes. Got it, then.</i>

00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:22.822
I came to escort you, Prince Seonghyeon.

00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:24.362
Get lost.

00:38:36.632 --> 00:38:38.712
Hold on. Hold on.

00:38:40.312 --> 00:38:44.082
Hoseondang. It has been a while.

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.612
Lower the sedan chair.

00:38:46.612 --> 00:38:47.962
Yes.

00:38:49.602 --> 00:38:52.442
I want to walk alone from here.

00:39:01.112 --> 00:39:03.962
<i>The more you get, the cheaper.</i>

00:39:43.582 --> 00:39:45.032
Yes.

00:39:45.032 --> 00:39:49.932
Do Hwa Seon's life would be
determined by her choices.

00:40:04.912 --> 00:40:07.182
- Cha Sun Chaek?
- Yes?

00:40:10.102 --> 00:40:11.822
Sun Chaek, right?

00:40:11.822 --> 00:40:12.992
Who...

00:40:12.992 --> 00:40:16.362
Do you not recognize me by chance?

00:40:17.732 --> 00:40:19.242
Look carefully.

00:40:19.242 --> 00:40:20.802
It is me, Yi Gyu.

00:40:20.802 --> 00:40:24.832
<i>Yi Gyu? I don't remember that name from the book.</i>

00:40:24.832 --> 00:40:26.992
Are you very surprised?

00:40:30.552 --> 00:40:34.512
Maybe I do remember.

00:40:34.512 --> 00:40:37.452
It's been a very long time, right?

00:40:37.452 --> 00:40:41.772
Yes. It's been over 10 years.

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:44.222
Ten years is long enough to not recognize you.

00:40:44.222 --> 00:40:46.612
We promised to marry each other as kids.

00:40:46.612 --> 00:40:48.982
I am disappointed.

00:40:48.982 --> 00:40:51.252
I recognized you instantly.

00:40:51.252 --> 00:40:54.182
<i>Huh? Promised to marry?</i>

00:40:54.182 --> 00:40:57.612
You sound different than before, too.

00:40:58.572 --> 00:41:01.332
Are you really the Sun Chaek I know?

00:41:01.332 --> 00:41:05.172
Well, t-the thing is...

00:41:05.172 --> 00:41:06.812
My Lady!

00:41:06.812 --> 00:41:10.172
- My Lady!
- Bang Wool, there you were.

00:41:10.172 --> 00:41:12.852
I'm in a hurry. Well, then.

00:41:12.852 --> 00:41:14.882
Sun Chaek. Sun Chaek...

00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:19.382
My Lady, who were you talking to?

00:41:29.642 --> 00:41:32.172
Who were you with?

00:41:32.172 --> 00:41:35.562
I don't know. I've never seen him before.

00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:37.702
But he said something about us being engaged.

00:41:37.702 --> 00:41:38.992
Pardon?

00:41:38.992 --> 00:41:41.532
You did not cause trouble behind my back, did you?

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.352
Probably not?

00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:09.342
Gosh, My Lord.

00:42:09.342 --> 00:42:13.312
I have never seen you so down before.

00:42:13.312 --> 00:42:17.522
It is because the Chief State
Minister is against it, right?

00:42:20.162 --> 00:42:23.532
Some things do not go the way I want them to.

00:42:23.532 --> 00:42:28.632
You have only been looking
straight ahead all this time.

00:42:28.632 --> 00:42:31.562
Same with the matters of the royal family...

00:42:31.562 --> 00:42:34.262
and marrying Lady Sun Chaek, too.

00:42:35.112 --> 00:42:38.482
They say to take a detour if the path is blocked.

00:42:38.482 --> 00:42:41.552
I think of this as an opportunity.

00:42:41.552 --> 00:42:47.282
An opportunity for you to enjoy
everyday happiness like everyone.

00:42:47.282 --> 00:42:49.522
Everyday happiness?

00:42:50.342 --> 00:42:52.732
Think about the scenery you missed

00:42:52.732 --> 00:42:56.122
while only running straight ahead.

00:42:56.122 --> 00:43:02.522
Those might be the most
precious moments in the end.

00:43:02.522 --> 00:43:05.812
Think as if you are taking a brief detour

00:43:07.012 --> 00:43:11.562
and try doing the things you
have wanted to do with Lady Cha.

00:43:20.771 --> 00:43:24.781
Bang Wool, isn't something strange?

00:43:24.781 --> 00:43:27.151
There are no pedestrians on the streets.

00:43:27.151 --> 00:43:29.651
It is not that there are none.

00:43:29.651 --> 00:43:31.271
They cannot come here.

00:43:31.271 --> 00:43:33.961
- Why not?
- Some impressive person...

00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:37.301
rented this entire area.

00:43:37.301 --> 00:43:40.101
- They rented this area?
- Yes.

00:43:45.851 --> 00:43:47.741
Prince Gyeongseong?

00:43:49.691 --> 00:43:52.931
Did you really rent this whole place?

00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:55.091
The entire market?

00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:57.961
Is that even possible?

00:43:57.961 --> 00:44:00.831
Of course. I am Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:44:00.831 --> 00:44:03.721
But you shouldn't have...

00:44:03.721 --> 00:44:06.821
I did not want our precious time to be interrupted.

00:44:25.971 --> 00:44:28.401
Thinking now,

00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.041
this is our first time walking
together holding hands.

00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:35.981
Let us discover...

00:44:35.981 --> 00:44:39.931
numerous small and big first moments together.

00:44:40.781 --> 00:44:42.361
Come on.

00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:45.341
You can sound so romantic, too.

00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:52.261
I want to go on a trip with you

00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:54.681
and go watch cherry blossoms together.

00:44:54.681 --> 00:44:59.121
The sky lanterns. I want us
to fly sky lanterns, too.

00:44:59.121 --> 00:45:00.821
I want us to see the ocean together, too.

00:45:00.821 --> 00:45:02.671
How about you?

00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:06.181
I do not care what it is.

00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:08.321
As long as I can be with you.

00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:11.941
Let us go.

00:45:16.331 --> 00:45:20.231
Can you still tell me something specific?

00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:23.291
Think of just one.

00:45:24.251 --> 00:45:27.021
Now, now. Stop!

00:45:38.441 --> 00:45:39.891
My turn.

00:45:39.891 --> 00:45:42.491
Wow, pretty good.

00:45:43.611 --> 00:45:44.771
You are bad, too.

00:45:44.771 --> 00:45:45.841
Everyone!

00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:47.041
My Lady is here!

00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:48.491
My Lady!

00:45:48.491 --> 00:45:50.801
Slow down. Slow down. Come here.

00:45:50.801 --> 00:45:53.381
Come here. Guess what I brought.

00:45:53.381 --> 00:45:55.931
- Ta-da.
- Snacks!

00:45:55.931 --> 00:45:58.321
Slow down. One by one. Eat slowly.

00:45:58.321 --> 00:45:59.701
Play with us like last time.

00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:01.541
Did we play hide and seek last time?

00:46:01.541 --> 00:46:03.531
- Read us a book, too.
- All right, all right.

00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:06.081
<i>Play with us! Play with us!</i>

00:46:06.081 --> 00:46:08.181
- Slow down.
<i>- Play with us! Play with us!</i>

00:46:08.181 --> 00:46:10.691
All right. Eat slowly.

00:46:10.691 --> 00:46:12.891
- Eat slowly.
- Everyone!

00:46:14.601 --> 00:46:17.881
You cannot harass the pretty lady.

00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:22.811
Here. This is for you.

00:46:22.811 --> 00:46:24.461
- Pass!
- It is mine!

00:46:24.461 --> 00:46:29.101
So, what brings you here, Sir?

00:46:29.101 --> 00:46:32.411
<i>- Give me!
- It is mine!</i>

00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:39.011
<i>Let me try.</i>

00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:44.801
Seeing those kids...

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:49.341
reminds me of when I used to wander
after losing my parents.

00:46:49.341 --> 00:46:54.241
Children suffer the most in difficult times.

00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:59.011
I did not expect to see you here, by the way.

00:46:59.011 --> 00:47:01.161
I was surprised, too.

00:47:01.161 --> 00:47:02.951
I will help a lot from now on.

00:47:02.951 --> 00:47:05.611
Let us do good together.

00:47:05.611 --> 00:47:10.301
I will teach them how to read whenever I can.

00:47:10.301 --> 00:47:11.961
Really?

00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:15.531
That would be greatly helpful.

00:47:15.531 --> 00:47:19.291
I like children.

00:47:23.161 --> 00:47:27.861
I think you will be a great husband.

00:47:29.781 --> 00:47:32.921
D-Do you mean it?

00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:55.291
Gosh, so pretty.

00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:59.351
They're all pretty.

00:48:01.341 --> 00:48:03.031
Should I buy you one?

00:48:06.961 --> 00:48:09.311
Looks so delicious.

00:48:10.381 --> 00:48:13.521
Prince Gyeongseong, say, ah.

00:48:18.701 --> 00:48:20.741
- Say, ah.
- Ah...

00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:42.241
So tasty.

00:49:06.781 --> 00:49:09.631
If you miss the opportunity right ahead,

00:49:09.631 --> 00:49:11.371
you will regret it forever.

00:49:11.371 --> 00:49:14.161
I cannot do it.

00:49:14.161 --> 00:49:17.091
It is not that you cannot. You are not doing it.

00:49:21.811 --> 00:49:25.601
Watch carefully and see how I win.

00:50:01.071 --> 00:50:03.811
The kids are having fun.

00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:08.021
Once you get into something,
you need to see it through, right?

00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:11.091
Why did you have to be so childish with the kids?

00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:14.741
I taught them to work hard for small things, too.

00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:18.561
Yes, yes. Of course you did.

00:50:18.561 --> 00:50:24.021
Still, I've never seen you
enjoying yourself so much.

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:27.981
Of course, I am planning to teach
this to our children, too.

00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:29.621
Our children?

00:50:29.621 --> 00:50:33.861
I realized I like how lively it is when

00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:35.971
there are many children around.

00:50:35.971 --> 00:50:38.041
So...

00:50:38.041 --> 00:50:40.911
is having 10 children enough for us?

00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:45.561
Why would you suddenly plan that now?

00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:50.291
The children's hanbok.

00:50:50.291 --> 00:50:52.831
I will take all of these here.

00:50:52.831 --> 00:50:55.191
Gosh, I don't know!

00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:58.391
Is 10 not enough?

00:50:58.391 --> 00:50:59.591
How about 12?

00:50:59.591 --> 00:51:02.101
I do not care if they are boys or girls.

00:51:30.031 --> 00:51:32.231
I did not think your favorite would be gukbap.

00:51:32.231 --> 00:51:34.451
It is so unexpected.

00:51:35.331 --> 00:51:39.301
It is the dish my father bought
me when we first met.

00:51:39.301 --> 00:51:43.911
Eating it reminds me of that time.

00:51:45.701 --> 00:51:48.401
Whenever I eat delicious food,

00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:52.081
I am reminded of my mother,
who passed when I was a kid.

00:51:54.151 --> 00:51:55.571
Since you look so aristocratic,

00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:59.451
I thought you had been pampered by your mother.

00:52:02.561 --> 00:52:04.511
Just like you,

00:52:05.451 --> 00:52:09.371
she felt rewarded for helping those in need.

00:52:10.391 --> 00:52:12.311
I am thinking of my mother...

00:52:12.311 --> 00:52:15.351
more than usual today.

00:52:31.261 --> 00:52:34.021
I showed you an embarrassing side of me.

00:52:34.021 --> 00:52:35.721
Not at all.

00:52:35.721 --> 00:52:39.241
I am grateful that you shared
what is in your heart.

00:52:46.001 --> 00:52:48.501
How is Merchant Cho these days?

00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:51.231
He is disappointed about the selection,

00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:54.301
but there is nothing that can be done.

00:52:55.861 --> 00:53:02.431
I think the Heavens decide who we end up with.

00:53:05.941 --> 00:53:09.241
I completely agree with you.

00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:22.161
What is wrong?

00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:25.031
I will go to the outhouse briefly.

00:53:52.151 --> 00:53:53.721
Father.

00:53:57.471 --> 00:53:59.801
Follow me.

00:53:59.801 --> 00:54:02.101
If you give me a moment...

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.711
I told you to follow me.

00:54:24.381 --> 00:54:27.061
The person you are with reflects who you are.

00:54:27.061 --> 00:54:28.351
I was just eating gukbap-

00:54:28.351 --> 00:54:30.921
Do you think I do not have eyes or ears?

00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:33.061
Why would you mingle with a lowly born

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:35.871
who does not know who her parents are.

00:54:35.871 --> 00:54:38.531
Are you in the right mind?

00:54:51.051 --> 00:54:54.151
His food is cold.

00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:56.431
Where did he go?

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.121
So pretty.

00:54:59.121 --> 00:55:01.141
Pretty, right?

00:55:05.601 --> 00:55:09.301
- Gosh, watch out for the bee, My Lady.
- Pardon?

00:55:09.321 --> 00:55:11.031
Hold still.

00:55:21.861 --> 00:55:24.211
This bee has a discerning taste.

00:55:24.211 --> 00:55:26.901
In this capital, no...

00:55:26.901 --> 00:55:31.551
it recognized the most beautiful
flower in this country.

00:55:31.551 --> 00:55:34.911
I guess I will spare its life.

00:55:34.911 --> 00:55:36.401
Is it okay if I did?

00:55:36.401 --> 00:55:38.451
Gladly.

00:55:43.231 --> 00:55:45.441
Do they not smell good?

00:55:45.441 --> 00:55:47.801
They smell amazing.

00:55:49.811 --> 00:55:51.741
Cha Sun Chaek,

00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:54.391
something urgent came up for me.

00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:56.151
Could you...

00:55:57.261 --> 00:55:59.301
wait for me at Bangmuljeon?

00:55:59.301 --> 00:56:01.371
What's it about?

00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:06.311
Something urgent came up.

00:56:07.991 --> 00:56:09.831
It must be very urgent.

00:56:09.831 --> 00:56:11.711
It is very urgent.

00:56:11.711 --> 00:56:13.551
It is right there.

00:56:13.601 --> 00:56:16.801
- Go ahead.
- All right.

00:56:16.851 --> 00:56:20.391
So, would you like some flowers?

00:56:21.981 --> 00:56:24.631
Prince Gyeongseong is cute.

00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:27.891
Which flowers will he give me?

00:56:29.701 --> 00:56:33.361
Are you not the cocktail maiden
from the Cha family?

00:56:33.361 --> 00:56:35.401
Cocktail maiden...

00:56:36.381 --> 00:56:40.201
Oh, yes. It is me.

00:56:40.201 --> 00:56:42.161
It is an honor to meet you.

00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:44.861
We are aware of your reputation.

00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:46.831
I heard you made rare drinks

00:56:46.831 --> 00:56:49.851
called cocktails at this teahouse.

00:56:49.851 --> 00:56:55.241
Could you give us a chance to try them today?

00:56:55.241 --> 00:56:59.061
I'm sorry, but I don't make that stuff anymore.

00:56:59.061 --> 00:57:01.791
Do not be like that. Share the good stuff with us.

00:57:01.791 --> 00:57:03.811
We will bring the top quality wines.

00:57:03.811 --> 00:57:05.351
- No, no. I can't.
- Let us go.

00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:08.331
- No, no.
- She said no.

00:57:15.051 --> 00:57:17.151
Are you okay, Sun Chaek?

00:57:19.701 --> 00:57:21.281
Who...

00:57:23.621 --> 00:57:27.121
Gosh, look who is here.

00:57:27.121 --> 00:57:28.541
It is Prince Seonghyeon.

00:57:28.541 --> 00:57:30.971
I thought you were dead since
I heard no news about you.

00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:33.611
But I returned instead of dying.

00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:37.101
I know you are the royal relatives,
but do not act like thugs.

00:57:37.101 --> 00:57:40.161
Why would you harass this delicate woman?

00:57:40.161 --> 00:57:42.141
- Let us go, Sun Chaek.
- Come now.

00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:44.911
Why would you get involved in her business?

00:57:44.911 --> 00:57:47.961
Have you no fear since you have
wandered for too long?

00:57:47.961 --> 00:57:51.101
You need to know when to step in or not

00:57:51.101 --> 00:57:53.841
to stay alive, at least.

00:57:55.201 --> 00:57:57.791
Keep pressuring someone who said no

00:57:57.791 --> 00:57:59.381
is an impolite thing to do.

00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.831
He suddenly cares about being polite?

00:58:01.831 --> 00:58:03.731
Please do not fight.

00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:05.941
I will teach you next time-

00:58:05.941 --> 00:58:08.901
Do not teach these rude men anything.

00:58:08.901 --> 00:58:12.101
Do you have a special relationship
with this maiden?

00:58:16.981 --> 00:58:19.541
If I did,

00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:20.881
would you step aside?

00:58:20.881 --> 00:58:23.911
Looks like you are trying to pick a fight with us.

00:58:23.911 --> 00:58:25.211
I know.

00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:29.391
You should be begging us to be nice to you.

00:58:32.591 --> 00:58:34.951
Are you okay?

00:58:34.951 --> 00:58:37.091
I am so ashamed of this, Sun Chaek.

00:58:37.091 --> 00:58:39.151
Three men are attacking one?

00:58:39.151 --> 00:58:41.671
Aren't you being too cowardly?

00:58:45.811 --> 00:58:47.491
Look...

00:58:53.961 --> 00:58:55.651
Did you get hurt? Let me see.

00:58:55.651 --> 00:58:57.931
I am okay, Sun Chaek.

00:59:44.341 --> 00:59:47.111

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.879
Su Beilu.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.439
I'm telling you,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.680
you guys must not go to Ninghai today.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.079
When your parents come back,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.239
just throw a tantrum.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.359
A huge tantrum.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.319
Tell them you don't want to go, okay?

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.239
You're not a teacher!

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:04.159
I've never seen you in the kindergarten!

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.040
Dad!

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.560
Mom!

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.960
- Mom!
- Bei!

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.840
What is wrong, Bei?

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.479
What's wrong, Bei? Why are you crying?

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.960
What happened, sweetheart?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.800
There's a kidnapper.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.080
Kidnapper?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.319
Where?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.199
Honey,

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.919
let's go.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.159
I don't think it's safe here.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.800
Don't go!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.479
Honey.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.039
We crashed.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.599
Honey.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.240
Are you alright?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.280
Bei, are you okay?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.080
I am fine.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.360
How are you driving?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.560
There is a child in the car.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.439
Get out.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.840
Why is it you again?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.360
Do not go to Ninghai.

00:03:02.377 --> 00:03:03.900
I am begging you. Do not go to Ninghai.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.470
What? Have you lost your mind?

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:07.220
You will get into a car accident today.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.360
A car will crash into you on the road!

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.039
Both of you will be killed.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.360
Only Bei will survive.

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:13.520
He will become an orphan.

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:15.630
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.879
Who are you, exactly?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680
Su Huabin.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.639
I am your son.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.280
I am Su Beilu
from twenty years in the future.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.439
For these twenty years,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.599
every single day,

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.960
I have been thinking about you.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.933
You have been gone
from my life for twenty years.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.080
And Grandma...

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.199
She is gone too.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.120
I am all alone now.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.240
I don't want you to die.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.159
Wait.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:51.759
My son

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.360
is in the car right now.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.159
Whoever you are,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.199
please don't joke with me like this.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.960
I know you don't believe me,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.919
but I truly regret it.

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:02.400
If it were not for me being reckless,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.639
insisting on going to
that Beach Carnival,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.800
you would never have died.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.360
It was me.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.560
I am the one who got you killed.

00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:17.239
Bei.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.950
Don't go over there.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.480
Bei.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:18.949
Bei.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.133
- Calm down.
- I am begging you.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.869
Please don't go to Ninghai today.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.680
If you don't go today,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.600
there will be many chances
to go in the future.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.000
But if you go today,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.920
there will never be another chance.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:30.680
Do not be so naughty, okay?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.839
I am not being naughty.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.279
I just want to spend the weekend
with Mom and Dad.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.720
I have not spent a weekend
with them in a long time.

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:52.000
You are the one
at the kindergarten gate.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.920
You are not a trainee teacher.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.120
Who are you, really?

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.680
I really am Su Beilu.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.360
I am Su Beilu
from twenty years in the future.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.720
I like origami.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.480
I like puppies.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.240
I like "The Monkey King".

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.879
At home, there are also three

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.720
Golden Cudgels.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.360
You and Grandma gave them to me, right?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.079
I...

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.680
Can you please not go to Ninghai?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.120
None of you goes to Ninghai.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.879
Do not go to Ninghai.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.079
Alright.

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.439
Thank you, Mom.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.040
Thank you.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.759
This is wonderful.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.439
Being able to save you

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.639
is truly wonderful.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.240
I never thought something
so unbelievable

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.560
would be believed by you.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.000
Blood really is thicker than water.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.879
It is such a relief
that you have calmed down.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.040
Dad, Mom,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.439
I may have to leave very soon.

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.399
But I believe

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.720
we will meet again
in the future very soon.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.720
And you.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.311
Remember to listen to Mom and Dad.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.600
Get in the car.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.279
Okay.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.920
Let's go, Bei.

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.079
Mom, where are you going?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.040
Wait.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.680
We are leaving.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.711
Get in the car, quick.

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:48.639
Dr. Su.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:49.629
Is this a patient?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.844
He was just in a car accident.

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:51.750
He hit his head.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.079
Dad, I am fine.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.920
Listen to me.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.920
I am a doctor.

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.759
A head injury

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.199
is a very serious matter.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.199
I think you

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.800
should get a scan,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.560
just to check

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.160
whether there are other issues, alright?

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.199
But I am fine right now.

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.199
I feel perfectly fine.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.759
I know you have been through things

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.319
that I might not be able to imagine,

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.759
but I believe you are strong.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.222
And I don't want you

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:13.190
to be left with any aftereffects,

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.120
alright?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.040
Song.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.319
Take him to the car.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:16.800
Okay.

00:07:16.866 --> 00:07:17.859
Dad, I really am fine.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.319
I will be in Ninghai for the weekend.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.399
Call me if anything comes up.

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.839
Dad, we agreed not to go to Ninghai!

00:07:21.844 --> 00:07:22.911
Sir. Calm down.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:24.070
You cannot go to Ninghai.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.200
Something will really happen.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.600
Why won't you believe me?

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.519
Dad!

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.040
You really cannot go to Ninghai!

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.439
Dad!

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.160
Come with me.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:30.800
Dad!

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.639
Let's go to the hospital
for a checkup, Sir.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.319
Dad!

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.319
You know,

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.639
just now,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.920
for a brief moment,

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.800
I almost believed

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.879
that young man was telling the truth.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.720
But still,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.560
how could that be possible?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.639
Even though he looked a bit unhinged,

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.639
how did he know

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.639
that our family
has three Golden Cudgels?

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:03.439
Sir. Please calm down.

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.079
Open the door!

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:04.959
Su Beilu!

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.399
Come with us for a checkup, Sir.
Do not be so impulsive!

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.160
Su Beilu!

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:11.720
Leave him to me.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.639
I am his family.

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.199
Bizhi.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.439
You must have a way, right?

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.160
Please help me.
My parents are good people.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.550
They'll be in a car accident.

00:08:17.555 --> 00:08:18.480
Please help me, alright?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480
Calm down, Su Beilu.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.439
I can't calm down!

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.439
Please help me!

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.759
Let's go home, Su Beilu.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:24.600
What?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.240
A car accident?

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:27.240
We are nearby.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Take care of him.
We are going to rescue people.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.519
What happened?

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.759
A sedan was hit.
Two adults and one child inside. Hurry!

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.759
What sedan?

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.320
What color was the car?

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:38.639
Go.

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.600
Say something!

00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:41.000
Let me get in the car.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.559
Bizhi.

00:09:06.622 --> 00:09:08.080
The accident has already happened.

00:09:08.088 --> 00:09:09.970
You are the only one
who can save my parents now.

00:09:09.977 --> 00:09:10.630
Please help me.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.799
Please help me!

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:17.279
Let's go home, Su Beilu.

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.159
What home?

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.559
This is my home.

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:20.919
They are my family.

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:22.519
If they are gone, where do I have to go?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.399
We can go back two hours earlier.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.120
Let me try one more time.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.559
One more time.
I can save them this time, okay?

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.639
Let me try again!

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.440
If the Time Administration
finds out what you did,

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.480
we will never be able
to time-travel again.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.120
Su Beilu.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:50.320
They are already dead.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320
You are still young.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.799
You are good-looking and capable.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.200
If you walk the right path,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.066
I believe you could
become a great person.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:38.639
Tuanzi.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:56.480
Let's go.

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:03.120
Do your injuries need treatment?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.039
No.

00:12:51.177 --> 00:12:53.111
(A devoted father. Su Huabin)
Su Beilu.

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:57.120
Why did you go back to Ninghai?

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.639
Why did you insist on
going back to Ninghai?

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.159
Why?

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:06.919
Why?

00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:26.360
I am so useless.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:30.360
I clearly had one chance,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.960
and still could not do it right.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.080
I don't understand.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.440
They clearly contributed
far more to society.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.840
They were
outstanding doctors and nurses.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.279
I am just worthless.

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:17.559
So why was I the only one who survived?

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:21.600
Or was all of this just a mistake?

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:26.600
Maybe the one
who should have died was me.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.240
If they were alive,

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.600
they could have saved
so many more lives.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.840
The past cannot be changed.

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:40.519
But why can't I try just once more?

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:43.679
Let me try one more time.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.799
I can save them. Just once.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:50.000
Come with me, Su Beilu.

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:28.720
Here...

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:32.440
I'm not allowed to enter this place...

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.000
So this is where you put
all the antiques you retrieved.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:58.639
Did you collect
all of these by yourself?

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.000
You have always been curious

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:05.039
why I went to such lengths
to find these artifacts.

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:07.360
You said

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.000
they were the belongings
of a close friend.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.519
So...

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.559
That was not wrong.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.519
But it was not accurate.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.399
The reason I collect these artifacts

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:20.039
is that I made a terrible mistake.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.879
And then kept repeating it.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.840
Now I speak of redemption,

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:31.390
but it is nothing more than seeking
a bit of comfort for my conscience.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.919
What exactly happened?

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:39.720
(Ten years ago,)

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:43.159
(all I wanted was to escape my own era.)

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.320
(So)

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:46.279
(I used this time elevator)

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.799
(and arrived in Luoyang
thousands of years ago.)

00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:51.399
Sorry.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.960
(There...)

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.039
I met a friend.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.639
His surname was Qin.

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:01.360
His given name was Ziyi.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.960
Who says we lack clothing?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.160
I will share my robe with you.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.839
A friend

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.240
is a companion who walks
the road of life with you.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.240
Even if the journey is short,

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.000
it is still a rare blessing.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:16.039
My friend.

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:19.680
(Though separated
by thousands of years,)

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.309
(Ziyi and I
understood each other deeply.)

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.220
(We felt like old friends
at the first meeting.)

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:28.759
(Only later did I learn)

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.279
(that Ziyi came from a noble lineage.)

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:34.640
(He was gentle by nature
and disliked conflict.)

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.279
To the world, elite heritage
was a badge of honor.

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:39.480
But to me,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.759
those illustrious families

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:44.160
were nothing more than shackles.

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:48.759
He said he was a bird trapped in a cage,

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:51.960
but I was also a prisoner
locked in a cell.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.039
(That shared fate
made us kindred spirits.)

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.920
(I decided to stay)

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.400
(and live on in this living world.)

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.960
Bizhi!

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:28.680
Bizhi!

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.400
Are you alright?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.480
I am fine.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.079
What is this?

00:18:33.288 --> 00:18:34.590
There are wolf packs in this area.

00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:36.444
It should be a trap set by local hunters

00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:37.720
to hunt wild wolves.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.960
Can you stand up?

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.440
I think my leg is injured.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.559
I will try.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.960
Hold on to the bow.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.839
I will pull you up.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.720
It is getting late.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.680
You should go back first.

00:19:00.777 --> 00:19:03.000
It is dangerous here.
There may be wild beasts.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.720
I can handle it on my own.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.160
Go.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.799
Go.

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:57.079
Ziyi?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.559
Why did you come down?

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:00.440
Sit down first.

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:01.759
Sit down first.

00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:05.160
Watch your step.

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:09.440
Your foot is injured.

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:10.759
If we run into wolves,

00:20:10.933 --> 00:20:12.644
you would not be able to fight them off.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.880
I have all my limbs intact.

00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:14.990
If we encounter a wolf pack,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.200
I can still protect myself.

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.119
Besides, I left markers along the way.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.920
Huo Shu will find us.

00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.799
I told you I could handle it.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.759
Why did you jump down?

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.160
Because you are my friend.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.680
I would never leave you behind.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.799
Bear with it.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.599
(Ziyi said)

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.559
(because I am his friend,)

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:55.119
(but what he didn't know was)

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.880
(that in this world,)

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.240
(he was my only friend.)

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.300
(Ya)

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.700
(She)

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.020
(Yashe)

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.180
(Yashe)

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.799
In the end, Ziyi could not escape
his family's internal strife.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.511
(A great fire consumed his residence,)

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:43.920
(destroying all the treasures
of the Treasure Trove,)

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.160
(and taking the life
of my only close friend.)

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.000
(Of course, I knew)

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.240
(that changing history)

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:02.519
(is the greatest taboo of time travel.)

00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:05.640
I had long grown used to being alone,

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:07.720
until I went to that era

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.799
and found a friend,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880
and found a bond.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.559
But one great fire
burned everything away.

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:19.400
(And I was alone again.)

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:22.440
(I would not accept it.)

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:25.359
(I would not accept it.)

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.640
I decided to rewrite
the ending of the story.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.279
(I returned to the night before Ziyi
was placed under house arrest.)

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:56.039
Stop!

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.480
Ziyi.

00:22:58.759 --> 00:22:59.880
I seek an audience.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:03.640
Bizhi?

00:23:04.079 --> 00:23:05.039
Why are you here?

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.880
Ziyi.

00:23:07.355 --> 00:23:08.400
I suddenly remembered

00:23:08.422 --> 00:23:10.420
there is an estate
on the outskirts of the city.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.240
Though simple,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.733
it has refined mountains and waters.

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:14.240
Since we are in the mood tonight,

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.480
why not go together

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.519
and stay a few days?

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.030
Thank you for your kindness.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.359
But it is already late.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.799
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.359
No.

00:23:21.488 --> 00:23:23.044
Tomorrow, there may be trivial matters,

00:23:23.044 --> 00:23:24.270
and we may not be able to go.

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:25.240
We should leave now.

00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:28.720
Bizhi, do you have something to say?

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:34.799
If you insist on returning
to the residence tonight,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.359
your life may be in danger.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.279
I know you worry
about the injustice done to me.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:53.359
Tonight,

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:54.799
a witness

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.880
has traveled a great distance
to help me.

00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.440
How could I refuse to see him?

00:23:58.759 --> 00:24:00.039
I am trying to save you.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.640
You must come with me.

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:07.200
Please come with me, Ziyi.

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:08.680
I am begging you.

00:24:09.022 --> 00:24:09.960
I am from the future...

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.400
Bizhi, there is no need to say more.

00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:20.400
No matter who you are,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.039
I won't go with you at this moment.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.400
I am not the one who clings
to life at any cost.

00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:30.799
Whatever may happen in the future,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.400
I will face it on my own.

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:35.880
What I seek

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.160
is an upright and honorable freedom.

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:43.200
That is my conviction.

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:47.160
I believe you should understand me.

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:54.839
Farewell.

00:25:03.555 --> 00:25:04.640
Return to the residence.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.920
Yes.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.440
(I thought that as long as
he didn't return to the residence,)

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.039
(he would be able to avoid that fire.)

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:35.599
(However, Ziyi had already
made up his mind.)

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:36.759
(And at that moment,)

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:38.119
(how could I possibly tell him)

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:40.200
(that what awaited him
was a raging fire?)

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.759
(All I could do was hope)

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:44.039
(that the witness Ziyi spoke of)

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:46.160
(would arrive from Shouyang Mountain
as promised,)

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.240
(and clear him of all false charges.)

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.079
(Clinging to a sliver of hope,
I waited until that day.)

00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:06.839
(But the outcome didn't change at all.)

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:08.200
(Yashe)

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200
(As snowflakes slowly drifted down,)

00:26:10.755 --> 00:26:13.070
(I knew the great fire
at his residence)

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.319
(had already burst into fierce flames.)

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.440
(Ziyi was once again
consumed by the fire.)

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.279
(The people I sent
to Shouyang Mountain to seek testimony,)

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.599
(and those I dispatched afterward,)

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.880
(all vanished without a trace.)

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.920
(Their fates are unknown.)

00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:37.920
(Only then did I realize...)

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:41.839
That it had been
a meticulously planned purge.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:45.880
That witness could never
have reached Luoyang.

00:26:46.599 --> 00:26:48.039
To save Ziyi,

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:50.319
relying on my strength alone

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.720
was utterly insufficient.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.880
So I used Yashe to return
once more to before the fire.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.400
I sought out General Huo Shu.

00:26:58.577 --> 00:27:01.110
(And told him that no matter what,
he must stay by Ziyi's side)

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.400
(and ensure his safety.)

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.400
General Huo,

00:27:04.511 --> 00:27:06.622
you must find a way to infiltrate
the Qin Residence

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:07.960
and protect him at all costs.

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:08.799
Rest assured.

00:27:08.844 --> 00:27:11.044
Young Master
once showed me great kindness.

00:27:11.155 --> 00:27:13.244
No matter what, I, Huo Shu,
will ensure his safety.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.720
I am counting on you.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:19.340
(Qin Residence)

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.820
(Qin Residence)

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.340
(Qin Residence)

00:27:34.288 --> 00:27:36.960
(After helping General Huo infiltrate
the Qin Residence,)

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:39.350
(I set off for Shouyang Mountain
to seek testimony.)

00:27:42.977 --> 00:27:44.000
(Who would have thought)

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.000
(that Ziyi was also concerned
for my safety,)

00:27:46.022 --> 00:27:48.070
(and actually sent General Huo
to protect me.)

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:49.799
Go!

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:55.279
Over there!

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240
(General Huo)

00:28:26.119 --> 00:28:27.799
(had died in my place, in vain.)

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.780
(Treasure Trove)

00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:43.960
(Tracing the current upstream,)

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:46.000
(the path is blocked and long.)

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:48.759
(So what if I failed?)

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.519
(I believed I still had a chance.)

00:28:56.119 --> 00:28:56.920
(This time,)

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.422
(I noticed that inside the school
beside the Qin Residence,)

00:28:59.422 --> 00:29:00.910
(there were several large water vats.)

00:29:00.911 --> 00:29:02.439
(They were likely prepared for fires.)

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.000
(I filled them with water in advance,)

00:29:04.044 --> 00:29:06.044
(thinking I might be able
to contain the blaze.)

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.680
The weather is dry.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.039
Please make sure these vats
are kept full of water,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.440
in case of an emergency.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.559
Young Master has spared
no expense for the school,

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.160
and secured prospects for the students.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.720
I will certainly safeguard
the Qin Residence.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.599
Then I leave it to you, Sir.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.519
I will repay you in the future.

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:27.039
Very well. No need for thanks.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.240
(I chose a narrow path.)

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.549
(It was winding,)

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.488
(but it allowed me
to avoid the assassins.)

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.799
(However,)

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:03.319
(by the time I returned to Luoyang...)

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.580
(Yashe)

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.640
(This time, I changed my strategy.)

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.319
(Official Sima at court
had long been close to Ziyi)

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.622
(and wielded considerable power.)

00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:57.510
(I decided to have Young Lady Caiwei
make a trip on Ziyi's behalf,)

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.839
(to seek Mr. Sima's protection.)

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.720
To ensure nothing went wrong,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.839
I sent Caiwei to Ziyi

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:04.960
to obtain a token.

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:06.799
It was Dushan Jade,

00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:09.111
the supreme emblem
of honor of the Qin Residence.

00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:11.920
My friend,

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:13.000
please look.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.839
This Dushan Jade mountain carving

00:31:16.911 --> 00:31:18.377
is a treasured heirloom of my family,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.079
our one and only family token.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:21.759
Whoever sees this jade

00:31:21.888 --> 00:31:23.666
may treat it as seeing me in person.

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.559
With this item,

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:29.039
Mr. Sima will surely
understand Ziyi's resolve

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.440
and will not stand idly by.

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:31.799
Young Lady Caiwei.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.839
You must deliver
this letter to Mr. Sima,

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:38.519
and take the Dushan Jade with you.

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:39.680
Yes.

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:43.440
To ensure nothing went wrong,

00:31:43.577 --> 00:31:46.350
I went to Shouyang Mountain a day
in advance to seek testimony,

00:31:46.422 --> 00:31:48.160
and returned early
to Luoyang to prepare.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:48.759
However,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.119
I was still ambushed.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.140
The fire burned
for three days and three nights.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.420
(Qin Residence)

00:32:32.666 --> 00:32:35.400
(When I dragged myself back to
the Qin Residence with an arrow wound,)

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:36.799
(the Qin Residence)

00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:38.440
(had already been reduced to ruins.)

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.160
(Caiwei may also have met
with misfortune.)

00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:43.319
(Mr. Sima)

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.519
(never appeared.)

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640
(From that point on,)

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.200
(I was like a gambler
who had lost all reason,)

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.440
(pushing open the door
of Yashe again and again,)

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.880
(only to wager on winning once,)

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.200
(to return everything
that was lost to its place.)

00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:33.680
(Until I finally realized)

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.559
(that my stubborn defiance)

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.039
(not only failed to save Ziyi,)

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.559
(but instead implicated
even more innocent people,)

00:33:41.079 --> 00:33:43.359
(causing their deaths
for no reason at all.)

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.000
(Tracing the current upstream,)

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:52.880
(the path is blocked and long.)

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:57.160
(Tracing the current upstream,)

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.440
(the path is steep and difficult.)

00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:06.440
(Tracing the current upstream,)

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.199
(the path twists to the right.)

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.599
I walked every path there was.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.199
In the end, I could only accept

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.519
that fate cannot be defied.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.960
Schemes exhausted to the utmost,

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.440
yet cleverness proved vain.

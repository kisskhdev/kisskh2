Here's the penalty
drink. The penalty drink.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.386
Please pass this on.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.736
- Drink it.
- I drank too much.

Well done.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.056
What is that?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.746
- What is that?
- What is that?

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.356
This is a new game that I created

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.616
just for the Seonmun Club.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.606
Removing a wooden block

without making the tower fall

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.546
is the first rule.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.616
And ask the question
that's written on the back

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.756
of the block to the
person who's on your right.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.280
The one who was asked the question
will have to give an answer.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.516
My Lady, I am about to lose my arm.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.826
What will you do with all these?

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.186
It's too many for the Yoot game.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.976
This is a game device
that's as groundbreaking

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.906
as my cocktail-making skills.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.070
Looks like you are all
about entertainment these days.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.886
Gosh, how vulgar.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.956
What is with all these questions?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.826
Considering they are Confucians,
I'm going easy on them.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.276
What happens if one cannot

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.516
answer the question?

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.800
There is a penalty drink.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.300
The penalty drink is made with

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.726
the notoriously strong hongsoju.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.256
It's more than just a penalty drink.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.026
It's basically a poison.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.896
You will have to answer, then.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.386
That makes this game...

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.406
This... merriment,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.280
so entertaining.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.780
Okay, let's decide on the order, then.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.796
Gosh.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.586
Lady Eun Ae, please start.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.226
It's not hard. Don't be nervous.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.740
Okay.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.030
What is the question?

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.336
"Your lover

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.066
turned into a bug.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.680
Would you save it or kill it?"

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.090
<i>Prince Gyeongseong
ended up with that question.</i>

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.956
Prince Gyeongseong, please answer.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.330
My lover turned into a bug.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.356
That would never happen.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.986
It is just imagination.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.406
How pathetic.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.016
I am only reading the question.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.186
I have no reason to answer
such a useless question.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.486
I think the questions in this merriment

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.456
- start with, "What if" -
- There is no what if.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.210
Because my lover will
never turn into a bug.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.500
You have to drink the penalty drink, then.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.836
Are you giving me an order now?

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.746
Gosh, I shouldn't have prepared this.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.310
I will drink this penalty drink.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.516
Are you okay, Maiden Sun Chaek?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.376
Come on now.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.296
It's just a merriment.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.110
I think we should stop now.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.880
I did not say I will not participate.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.540
[What is the color
of the underwear you are wearing?]

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.666
<i>So cold.</i>

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.946
<i>Something as sharp as ice in a highball</i>

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.626
<i>flew and pierced me.</i>

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.330
When was your last kiss?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.806
<i>Was there a question like that?</i>

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.436
<i>Did Bang Wool write that?</i>

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.716
Are you not ready to answer?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.906
Are you refusing to answer

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.086
or can you not?

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.126
What do you mean I cannot answer?

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.126
I will answer.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.850
I

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.776
Have never kissed anyone
since the moment I was born.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.856
How could a daughter of a nobleman

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.856
dare to make my lips available?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.880
- What was that, then?
- Pardon?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.580
The thing we did together the other night.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.490
What nonsense are you spewing right now?

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.796
Nonsense?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.796
What are you imagining?

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.226
I just

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.000
wanted to talk about the promise
we made the other night.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.290
There will be a wedding soon?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.520
Mother!

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.886
Why are you making
a fuss at this late hour?

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.426
Something terrible happened.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.296
- Something terrible?
- We received

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.906
a wedding proposal at our house.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.700
What are you saying out of the blue?

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.056
To avoid misunderstanding,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.016
I will make something clear now.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.106
I, Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.380
am planning to

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.530
marry Maiden Cha Sun Chaek.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.006
Maiden, what is he talking about?

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.030
T-That's not it...

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.800
Lady Eun Ae.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.296
Give me water...

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.956
- Water. Water.
- Water, please.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.350
Water. Water.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.096
Maiden Eun Ae.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.456
<i>I brought that to make a peach cocktail.</i>

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.550
<i>Is she allergic to peach, by chance?</i>

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.506
What a splendid hazing ceremony.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.640
You surely are qualified to be my bride.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.716
You

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.640
must be crazy.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.986
I am crazy,

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.920
for Cha Sun Chaek.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.120
<i>This can never happen.</i>

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.086
I want to hear a good reason.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.736
My daughter is not
ready to get married yet.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.076
<i>What a twist.</i>

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.066
<i>I didn't expect a response like this.</i>

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.570
I said she already took my virginity away.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.186
She can live with me for
the rest of her life, then.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.656
It sounds like you do not care if she

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.826
remains unwed for the rest of her life.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.556
<i>He's so blindly obsessed.</i>

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.766
Not just one but three of Sun Chaek's
older brothers have not married.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.376
They need to get married first.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.266
I do not think

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.966
it would be too late for her
to get married afterward.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.586
<i>I didn't think my brothers
could be my shield.</i>

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.226
But do you not think

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.780
her opinion matters the most?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.276
Yes, Sun Chaek. You tell me.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.660
Do you really want to marry him, too?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.530
I...

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.996
<i>Say you don't want to.</i>

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.536
<i>Why are you hesitating?</i>

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.046
<i>Are you wavering, by chance?</i>

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.656
<i>Even so, I can't get married now.</i>

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.440
Sun Chaek.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.676
I will just

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.846
do what you want me to do, Father.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.316
I do not know how My Lord has come to

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.486
hold something over my daughter's head.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.716
Hold something over her head?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.396
I think you are very mistaken.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.486
She is the one who holds
something over my head.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.966
What do you mean by that?

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.006
The one who kissed me first that night

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.106
was your daughter.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.236
Sun Chaek...

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.716
Hyungnim, you need to stay alert.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.000
Do you want to hear more?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.606
Stop!

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.156
Please stop.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.890
What are you saying in front of my parents?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.366
I want to ask if you still oppose it.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.790
Actually, the biggest reason for me

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.920
is something else.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.286
I do not

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.646
want my daughter to join the royal family.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.006
I want my Sun Chaek

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:04.250
to marry into a very ordinary family.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.196
Since I made myself clear to you,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.410
I will go back inside.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.026
You should go inside, too.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.500
Yes.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.480
My Lady, let's go.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.570
Talk to me for a moment.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.276
Spare us.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.426
It is not that we did
not want to get married.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.680
T-That is right. It is rather we could not...

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.910
You must be so proud.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.070
- H-Hyungnim.
- Calm down. It is okay.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.416
I do not think

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.366
it is right for you to get involved

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.870
in our family business.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.036
You are the biggest problem.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.236
This is what is wrong with the scholars.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.926
They get absorbed in their studies
and avoid reality.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.646
Do not get in the way
of your sister's future

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.956
and be gone now.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.926
Spare me!

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.700
Spare me.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.536
I will generously give you two months.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.286
Find your marriage
prospects within that time

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.000
and get married.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.980
We could not do it our whole lives.
How could we suddenly.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.520
I am being as patient as I can be.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.796
After that,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.970
even I do not know how
I would get rid of you.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.556
I noticed you have been strange lately.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.686
What do I do with you?

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.910
I'm sorry.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.726
Bring me a knife.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.060
- Madam.
- Hurry.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.496
<i>Yes. I can't get married
with a shaved head.</i>

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.400
<i>Nice.</i>

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.460
I will do what you want me to do, Mother.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.426
Mother.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.496
I will let you cut it if you want.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.020
It is okay.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.376
To be honest, I am on board.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.806
Pardon?

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.876
I want Prince Gyeongseong as my son-in-law.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.456
There are scary rumors about him

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.806
and as Father said, my brothers
should take time to get married

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.316
and I should marry into an ordinary family.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.166
Wouldn't that make me happy?

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.766
According to my life experience,

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.710
men are all about their looks.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.976
It is possible to lose power and wealth.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.910
But one's appearance does not change.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.066
They say if you live with a handsome man,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.506
your anger naturally goes away.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.766
I could not have one myself,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.106
but I hope you do.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.176
M-Mother.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.856
And I think this is a great chance to get

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.490
your brothers married at once, too.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.060
<i>Has she always been like this?</i>

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.870
<i>She's nothing like what I expected.</i>

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.036
Prince Bokyang's son
is a child of a concubine.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.670
That makes Beon the perfect candidate.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.666
To make that happen,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.110
you must step forward.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.406
Be ambitious.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.870
For our Beon's sake.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.190
I married you in order to do this.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.426
But I...

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.130
You must strike first.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.126
If you cannot do it,

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.450
I will do it.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.616
They say a man and wife
are one in body and soul.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.416
Are you on the same page as her, Hyungnim?

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.886
You are mistaken.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.256
You know.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.120
I am not interested in the throne at all.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.966
Spare me.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.906
I will go somewhere far away with my son

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.056
and become reclusive

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.520
so no one sees us. Please.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.406
I am not sure.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:16.080
I cannot believe what humans say.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.176
No!

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.636
S-Spare him.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.706
Please let my father live.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.296
I will do anything you
want me to do, Uncle.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.526
Please. Please spare him this once.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.576
Really?

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.820
No matter what that might be?

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.560
Can you swing that sword for me?

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.516
<i>I ended up getting blood on my hands.</i>

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.670
<i>To survive.</i>

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.910
I am sorry.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.186
Because I am so weak

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.470
I could not protect you.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.536
I hope

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.826
you will

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.920
no longer

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.180
be in pain.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.790
<i>A life where family point
their swords at each other.</i>

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.116
<i>I wanted to put an end to it.</i>

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.770
<i>But...</i>

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.406
<i>To be honest, I know everything.</i>

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.690
<i>The secrets you keep.</i>

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.686
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.430
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.600
If she got to meet her,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.750
she would have liked her a lot.

00:23:16.735 --> 00:23:21.115
<i>Your Highness, it is my wish. Please.</i>

00:23:23.765 --> 00:23:26.751
Prince Gyeongseong already
has a woman he wants to marry.

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:28.651
But he has not married her yet.

00:23:28.675 --> 00:23:31.021
Do you not have any self-respect?

00:23:31.045 --> 00:23:32.391
I do not care.

00:23:32.415 --> 00:23:35.131
I need to have Prince
Gyeongseong, no matter what.

00:23:35.155 --> 00:23:38.031
So, help me. Please?

00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:41.115
You are capable of doing so.

00:23:52.485 --> 00:23:56.711
You have always told me that I resemble you

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:59.471
the most in the family.

00:23:59.495 --> 00:24:04.215
I rely on you more than my mother.

00:24:07.535 --> 00:24:09.121
What is family?

00:24:09.145 --> 00:24:11.541
What is bloodline?

00:24:11.565 --> 00:24:14.111
Are you granting my request?

00:24:14.135 --> 00:24:16.465
You are the best, Queen Mother.

00:24:20.795 --> 00:24:23.125
Let me see.

00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:25.905
If so...

00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:33.855
This just won't come off.

00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:37.951
We got into a fight over
drinks and even a fire.

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:40.341
Even the lead character can't handle

00:24:40.365 --> 00:24:43.345
a ridiculous plot like this.

00:24:47.345 --> 00:24:49.961
<i>I am worried about Sun
Chaek. Should we go in?</i>

00:24:49.985 --> 00:24:51.141
<i>We cannot.</i>

00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:52.741
<i>She is not feeling so well.</i>

00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:53.961
<i>It is not a good time.</i>

00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:56.271
<i>But still, I am worried. Let us go in.</i>

00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:58.595
Come on in.

00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:09.411
We were just worried about you, Sun Chaek.

00:25:09.435 --> 00:25:11.671
This is all Prince Gyeongseong's fault.

00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:15.181
You cannot marry against your will.

00:25:15.205 --> 00:25:19.031
We will be sure to help you. Do not worry.

00:25:19.055 --> 00:25:21.421
Even if P-Prince Gyeongseong barged in,

00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:23.611
w-we will protect you.

00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:25.481
T-The three of us

00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:28.755
can surely fight Prince Gyeongseong!

00:25:37.285 --> 00:25:41.935
You are incredibly reassuring.

00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:46.661
With all that ruckus yesterday,

00:25:46.685 --> 00:25:48.351
take care of yourself first.

00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.811
Yes. I heard everyone
who was there is not well.

00:25:51.835 --> 00:25:54.731
<i>Right. Eun Ae.</i>

00:25:54.755 --> 00:25:56.941
<i>I somehow feel bad.</i>

00:25:56.965 --> 00:25:59.251
<i>I wonder if she's okay.</i>

00:25:59.275 --> 00:26:01.131
Brothers,

00:26:01.155 --> 00:26:04.775
I think I need to rest a bit.

00:26:17.265 --> 00:26:18.691
Are you ready to start the day, Father?

00:26:18.715 --> 00:26:20.561
Are you leaving now?

00:26:20.585 --> 00:26:23.311
I went to bed late
while reading last night.

00:26:23.335 --> 00:26:25.931
I heard there was a big fire last night.

00:26:25.955 --> 00:26:29.511
They say the fire started where you
had your club meeting.

00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:31.511
Am I misinformed?

00:26:31.535 --> 00:26:35.141
I did not tell you in case you'd worry.

00:26:35.165 --> 00:26:38.431
- My apologies.
- You should behave differently in your position.

00:26:38.455 --> 00:26:41.091
How much longer will you play around?

00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:44.731
If I hear something
shameful like this again,

00:26:44.755 --> 00:26:47.521
I will no longer ignore it.

00:26:47.545 --> 00:26:49.355
Do you understand?

00:26:52.215 --> 00:26:54.411
I will be careful

00:26:54.435 --> 00:26:58.071
as much as I can, so as
not to worry you, Father.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:26:59.991
[Prince Gyeongseong is
getting married? I What? ]

00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:01.471
[With whom? I Is it true someone
holds something over him?]

00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:02.541
[That is just ridiculous!]

00:27:02.565 --> 00:27:03.731
[Will his wedding be a
royal event? I It's a lie]

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:06.465
[How vulgar / I heard there's a reason]

00:27:09.875 --> 00:27:11.661
That is her. That is her.

00:27:11.685 --> 00:27:13.161
Is that not the Chief
State Minister's daughter?

00:27:13.185 --> 00:27:14.891
They are getting married.

00:27:14.915 --> 00:27:16.835
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

00:27:18.765 --> 00:27:19.901
I'm sorry!

00:27:19.925 --> 00:27:21.241
My gosh.

00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:23.461
Are you okay?

00:27:23.485 --> 00:27:25.635
Did I hit him hard?

00:27:28.155 --> 00:27:29.511
A foreigner?

00:27:29.535 --> 00:27:31.131
Help...

00:27:31.155 --> 00:27:33.121
W-What did you say?

00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:35.851
Help me...

00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:38.275
Help!

00:27:39.385 --> 00:27:40.621
Help!

00:27:40.645 --> 00:27:44.265
Someone fell! Please help!

00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:49.821
I'll use the CPR techniques
I learned in high school.

00:27:49.845 --> 00:27:51.425
Like this.

00:27:56.245 --> 00:27:59.005
I'm hungry.

00:28:00.615 --> 00:28:02.601
My stomach hurts.

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:04.211
Y-You're hungry?

00:28:04.235 --> 00:28:06.491
I'm hungry.

00:28:06.515 --> 00:28:09.425
Oh, you're hungry?

00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:16.161
Delicious?

00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:17.731
Korean soup.

00:28:17.755 --> 00:28:19.001
So good.

00:28:19.025 --> 00:28:20.665
I'm glad.

00:28:21.555 --> 00:28:22.751
- Ma'am!
- Yes.

00:28:22.775 --> 00:28:24.211
Another bowl, please.

00:28:24.235 --> 00:28:25.491
Same order?

00:28:25.515 --> 00:28:26.895
Yes.

00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:34.121
So, you got stranded because of a storm

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:35.331
and ended up here?

00:28:35.355 --> 00:28:39.131
Yes. I had to go to Japan,

00:28:39.155 --> 00:28:42.025
but the ship I sailed on and the wave.

00:28:44.815 --> 00:28:46.241
I see.

00:28:46.265 --> 00:28:48.731
I'm so sorry, man.

00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:52.141
What is your name?

00:28:52.165 --> 00:28:54.871
My name is Mark. Mark.

00:28:54.895 --> 00:28:57.111
Mark. Mark?

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:59.561
I'm Sun Chaek.

00:28:59.585 --> 00:29:00.871
Sun Chaek.

00:29:00.895 --> 00:29:03.165
- Sun Chaek.
- Yes.

00:29:06.435 --> 00:29:11.251
Sorry, you're having
trouble ending up here.

00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:13.081
I was like that at first, too.

00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:16.475
"Where am I? Who am I?"

00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:20.051
Mark, this must be meant to be.

00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:24.081
I will buy you clothes.

00:29:24.105 --> 00:29:26.165
- Really?
- Yes.

00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:31.061
Lady Sun Chaek.

00:29:31.085 --> 00:29:33.281
- Long time no see.
- Yes.

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.391
Are you looking for silk
garments for your wedding

00:29:36.415 --> 00:29:37.711
with Prince Gyeongseong?

00:29:37.735 --> 00:29:39.111
Pardon? Wedding?

00:29:39.135 --> 00:29:40.561
Everyone in the capital is

00:29:40.585 --> 00:29:45.415
saying you are Prince Gyeongseong's
fiancée right now.

00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:47.941
For your wedding,

00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:50.431
please let me make your garments.

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:53.075
I will make you the best one.

00:29:55.255 --> 00:29:58.491
I'm not shopping for myself today.

00:29:58.515 --> 00:30:02.495
M-Mark! Over here. Here, here.

00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:06.395
He's the one who needs clothes.

00:30:08.455 --> 00:30:09.931
What's wrong?

00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:13.521
I am a bit afraid of Westerners.

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:18.731
They say you can get
an unknown disease, too.

00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:20.271
My gosh!

00:30:20.295 --> 00:30:23.661
They just look a bit different than us.

00:30:23.685 --> 00:30:25.511
Have pity on him.

00:30:25.535 --> 00:30:28.561
I'll be responsible if anything happens.

00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:33.051
So, don't worry and make him one outfit.

00:30:33.075 --> 00:30:35.821
Since it is your request,

00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:37.961
I will make an outfit, I suppose.

00:30:37.985 --> 00:30:42.855
And could you find him a place to stay?

00:30:44.845 --> 00:30:47.051
Yes, I will.

00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:48.631
Thank you.

00:30:48.655 --> 00:30:52.615
Well, follow me. Follow me.

00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:56.171
Thank you, Sun Chaek.

00:30:56.195 --> 00:30:58.015
You're welcome.

00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:01.551
Yes, come on in.

00:31:01.575 --> 00:31:04.215
Now, I should get to it.

00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:12.671
You came, Lady Sun Chaek.

00:31:12.695 --> 00:31:14.571
Is Lady Eun Ae inside?

00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:15.841
I am sorry.

00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:18.211
My Lady is not home right now.

00:31:18.235 --> 00:31:20.951
Oh, I see.

00:31:20.975 --> 00:31:23.031
How's she feeling, by the way?

00:31:23.055 --> 00:31:26.841
She is better since she took medicine.

00:31:26.865 --> 00:31:28.241
That's a relief.

00:31:28.265 --> 00:31:31.545
I will let her know you stopped by.

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.585
Okay.

00:31:56.895 --> 00:32:00.061
Are you His Excellency
Cha's daughter, by chance?

00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:01.621
Do you know me?

00:32:01.645 --> 00:32:02.811
It is you.

00:32:02.835 --> 00:32:04.391
Eun Ae told me a lot about you.

00:32:04.415 --> 00:32:08.451
I am her father, Cho Byeong Mu.

00:32:08.475 --> 00:32:11.201
Yes, hello.

00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:13.245
Nice to meet you.

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:17.165
You look way younger than I thought.

00:32:18.295 --> 00:32:19.591
I-It's nothing.

00:32:19.615 --> 00:32:24.411
I was curious if Lady
Eun Ae was feeling better.

00:32:24.435 --> 00:32:27.101
That is why I stopped by briefly.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:30.121
I was there when the
fire started last night.

00:32:30.145 --> 00:32:32.501
Oh, I see.

00:32:32.525 --> 00:32:37.211
You are a noblewoman,
but you care about my daughter.

00:32:37.235 --> 00:32:38.891
Thank you.

00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:41.875
Of course, I should. She's my friend.

00:32:45.245 --> 00:32:49.731
You are pure, as if you
grew up without any worries

00:32:49.755 --> 00:32:52.131
your whole life.

00:32:52.155 --> 00:32:53.341
Thank you.

00:32:53.365 --> 00:32:58.185
I hope Eun Ae turns out
like you, Lady Sun Chaek.

00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:01.691
She is in

00:33:01.715 --> 00:33:04.871
your care from now on, My Lady.

00:33:04.895 --> 00:33:06.905
Of course.

00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:10.045
I'll get going now.

00:33:41.435 --> 00:33:44.065
My Lady, drink your medicine.

00:33:47.075 --> 00:33:48.291
What medicine is this?

00:33:48.315 --> 00:33:50.871
It is a medicine made with chamber bitter.

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:53.921
Prince Gyeongseong brought himself.

00:33:53.945 --> 00:33:56.475
Oh, right.

00:33:58.655 --> 00:34:01.675
I feel bad that he's
been doing stuff for me.

00:34:02.885 --> 00:34:05.185
I wonder if he's feeling okay.

00:34:11.515 --> 00:34:13.241
Why am I thinking of him?

00:34:13.265 --> 00:34:15.631
Why do I worry about him?

00:34:15.655 --> 00:34:18.131
Whatever. Don't get sucked in.

00:34:18.155 --> 00:34:20.515
Don't read into things.

00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:23.421
How dare you worry about him?

00:34:23.445 --> 00:34:25.741
Worry about yourself.

00:34:25.765 --> 00:34:27.801
If I didn't do it,

00:34:27.825 --> 00:34:30.911
Eun Ae would've done it.

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:32.561
My Lady?

00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:33.991
What are you doing?

00:34:34.015 --> 00:34:35.771
Huh? It's nothing.

00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:37.321
Go ahead and drink the medicine.

00:34:37.345 --> 00:34:39.635
The precious stuff is getting cold.

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:44.025
I can't stand anything bitter.

00:34:57.895 --> 00:35:00.995
What was that? Am I hearing things?

00:35:08.525 --> 00:35:09.851
I heard it, too.

00:35:09.875 --> 00:35:13.851
It sounded like a stone hitting the window.

00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:15.585
Gosh, hurry.

00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:28.665
My gosh.

00:35:35.775 --> 00:35:37.905
Sir Su Gyeom.

00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:47.901
I wanted to see you,

00:35:47.925 --> 00:35:50.685
but it was late, and I felt impatient...

00:35:51.445 --> 00:35:54.321
This was the only way to see you.

00:35:54.345 --> 00:35:56.691
<i>It is okay.</i>

00:35:56.715 --> 00:36:00.975
<i>I must've scared you at the last meeting.</i>

00:36:02.275 --> 00:36:04.261
I am so relieved that

00:36:04.285 --> 00:36:06.605
you did not get hurt.

00:36:07.595 --> 00:36:12.115
Did you come here because
you were worried about me?

00:36:13.115 --> 00:36:16.631
There is something I need to tell you.

00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:20.751
I-If you heard about me
marrying Prince Gyeongseong.

00:36:20.775 --> 00:36:22.991
<i>Well...</i>

00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:24.521
The thing is...

00:36:24.545 --> 00:36:27.161
<i>This atmosphere. This reaction.</i>

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.061
<i>This situation is...</i>

00:36:29.085 --> 00:36:31.421
<i>Is he confessing his love by chance?</i>

00:36:31.445 --> 00:36:34.471
<i>I think he's here to confirm if it's true</i>

00:36:34.495 --> 00:36:36.821
<i>I'm with Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

00:36:36.845 --> 00:36:41.401
<i>What's the deal?
Did Jung Su Gyeom fall for me, too?</i>

00:36:41.425 --> 00:36:44.661
<i>You might find this to be a burden, but...</i>

00:36:44.685 --> 00:36:47.941
<i>His voice says he's suppressing jealousy.</i>

00:36:47.965 --> 00:36:51.601
<i>Because our bodies
touched in front of the wall,</i>

00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:54.651
<i>he's getting fired up.</i>

00:36:54.675 --> 00:36:57.341
<i>Gosh, is this my fate?</i>

00:36:57.365 --> 00:37:00.185
<i>I try to deny it, but I can't.</i>

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:04.561
<i>You seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.</i>

00:37:04.585 --> 00:37:07.851
<i>This is treason.</i>

00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:11.621
You might have noticed it already,

00:37:11.645 --> 00:37:13.461
but Maiden Sun Chaek,

00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:14.751
I

00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:16.631
<i>No! You can't!</i>

00:37:16.655 --> 00:37:18.691
- I love...
<i>- You can't love me.</i>

00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:21.425
<i>- You cannot!</i>
- I love Lady Eun Ae.

00:37:52.485 --> 00:37:54.871
Not me,

00:37:54.895 --> 00:37:57.195
but Lady Eun Ae?

00:38:01.005 --> 00:38:04.291
Of course, you are an exceptional woman

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:06.585
who is not lacking in any way.

00:38:08.455 --> 00:38:12.081
But I fell for Lady Eun Ae when she bravely

00:38:12.105 --> 00:38:15.575
<i>took the penalty drink
for me as a weak vessel.</i>

00:38:18.065 --> 00:38:20.031
Was that really enough,

00:38:20.055 --> 00:38:23.805
for you to fall in love with Lady Eun Ae?

00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:30.645
I have been looking for someone

00:38:31.595 --> 00:38:33.721
who is gentle and strong like her.

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:35.641
But

00:38:35.665 --> 00:38:40.745
why are you telling me this?

00:38:42.245 --> 00:38:45.451
I could not tell her how I feel yet.

00:38:45.475 --> 00:38:47.791
Even I am flustered by how I feel.

00:38:47.815 --> 00:38:52.021
I have no idea what she would think of it.

00:38:52.045 --> 00:38:53.461
<i>Right.</i>

00:38:53.485 --> 00:38:57.761
<i>In the book, Eun Ae briefly met Su Gyeom,</i>

00:38:57.785 --> 00:39:00.825
<i>but she ended up with Yi Beon.</i>

00:39:02.805 --> 00:39:05.161
So.

00:39:05.185 --> 00:39:11.285
Are you asking me to
help you end up together?

00:39:12.595 --> 00:39:14.171
That is right, Maiden Sun Chaek.

00:39:14.195 --> 00:39:18.345
I knew you would understand how I feel.

00:39:20.055 --> 00:39:24.481
I know I am asking a lot, but I would

00:39:24.505 --> 00:39:27.481
find your advice very helpful.

00:39:27.505 --> 00:39:29.071
<i>Hold on.</i>

00:39:29.095 --> 00:39:32.681
<i>Eun Ae needs to end up with Yi Beon.</i>

00:39:32.705 --> 00:39:35.225
<i>If I help him now.</i>

00:39:37.385 --> 00:39:41.461
I knew it was too much to ask.

00:39:41.485 --> 00:39:44.555
You must be busy with
the goings on at home.

00:39:47.545 --> 00:39:49.071
Wait...

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:54.141
Could you give me some time to think?

00:39:54.165 --> 00:39:59.955
I want to try talking to Lady Eun Ae, too.

00:40:02.185 --> 00:40:05.111
Do you mean it, Maiden Sun Chaek?

00:40:05.135 --> 00:40:08.815
I feel as if I've gained
a thousand soldiers and horses.

00:40:25.095 --> 00:40:27.335
I am planning to get married.

00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:31.395
I will soon introduce her to you...

00:42:15.552 --> 00:42:17.838
Heuksa Clan is

00:42:17.862 --> 00:42:20.868
back to being active?

00:42:20.892 --> 00:42:23.148
Not only that but the clan and its movement

00:42:23.172 --> 00:42:26.988
is stronger and more
aggressive than before.

00:42:27.012 --> 00:42:29.638
Toughen security at Gangnyeongjeon

00:42:29.662 --> 00:42:33.852
and try not to leave
the Palace for a while.

00:42:34.932 --> 00:42:39.672
You have a lot to worry
about, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:42:40.952 --> 00:42:43.742
Come. Come closer.

00:42:58.802 --> 00:43:01.572
Is it because you have someone to protect?

00:43:02.492 --> 00:43:06.758
Your eyes never wavered from any threats,

00:43:06.782 --> 00:43:09.572
but I can see fear in them.

00:43:19.232 --> 00:43:20.748
Sun Chaek,

00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:23.048
give me a city tour, please?

00:43:23.072 --> 00:43:25.528
City tour?

00:43:25.552 --> 00:43:28.508
Oh, sightseeing?

00:43:28.532 --> 00:43:31.088
I have something to do.

00:43:31.112 --> 00:43:34.058
I'm sorry. Next time, okay?

00:43:34.082 --> 00:43:35.158
I need you.

00:43:35.182 --> 00:43:37.632
Sun Chaek is my only friend.

00:43:40.302 --> 00:43:42.952
Okay, let's go.

00:43:48.812 --> 00:43:50.908
- Mask.
- Mask?

00:43:50.932 --> 00:43:52.852
Tal. Tal.

00:43:59.122 --> 00:44:01.748
This is gat.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:03.098
Gat?

00:44:03.122 --> 00:44:04.582
Hat.

00:44:09.892 --> 00:44:11.192
Say, ah.

Fantastic.

We're here.

00:44:20.872 --> 00:44:22.848
Mark, I really need to go now.

00:44:22.872 --> 00:44:25.298
Okay, but

00:44:25.322 --> 00:44:27.192
thanks for today.

00:44:29.282 --> 00:44:30.239
Bye.

00:44:30.263 --> 00:44:32.038
- Rest well.
- Love you. Bye.

00:44:32.062 --> 00:44:33.822
See you soon.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:36.822
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:45:14.322 --> 00:45:16.652
Come, open the door.

00:45:45.912 --> 00:45:49.112
I didn't even get to see Eun Ae.

00:45:50.422 --> 00:45:52.632
What's wrong with me?

00:45:53.632 --> 00:45:56.658
<i>I'm cold and dizzy.</i>

00:45:56.682 --> 00:45:58.872
<i>Why am I...</i>

00:46:06.862 --> 00:46:08.782
What's wrong?

00:46:10.012 --> 00:46:12.988
Are you okay? Should I call a physician?

00:46:13.012 --> 00:46:15.138
Are you okay, maiden?

00:46:15.162 --> 00:46:18.822
- Blood!
- Are you okay?

00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:32.198
<i>Heuksa Clan is so tenacious and sneaky.</i>

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:34.922
You must know that better than anyone.

00:46:35.902 --> 00:46:39.048
Be careful so you do not lose

<i>what you cherish.</i>

00:46:58.542 --> 00:47:00.922
My Lord...

00:47:02.672 --> 00:47:05.058
Yes, where is Lady Sun Chaek?

00:47:05.082 --> 00:47:10.358
The soldiers took My Lady.

00:47:10.382 --> 00:47:13.328
They took her? What do you mean?

00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:15.778
She...

00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:18.982
She got the plague, they say.

00:47:21.092 --> 00:47:25.142
She cannot even stand straight.

00:47:50.172 --> 00:47:52.578
I will go in.

00:47:52.602 --> 00:47:55.338
We were told not to let anyone in.

00:47:55.362 --> 00:47:57.138
Do you not know who I am?

00:47:57.162 --> 00:47:58.139
It is the King's order.

00:47:58.163 --> 00:48:01.228
I will cut your throat if you do not move.

00:48:01.252 --> 00:48:03.172
Forgive me.

00:48:18.922 --> 00:48:22.008
I will give you this Howon Sword.

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:23.838
Cut it up or melt it.

00:48:23.862 --> 00:48:25.618
Do whatever you wish.

00:48:25.642 --> 00:48:29.308
You must know what kind of sword this is.

00:48:29.332 --> 00:48:32.258
We have no choice but
to follow the King's order.

00:48:32.282 --> 00:48:35.042
If you end up catching it, too.

00:48:39.552 --> 00:48:41.412
I do not care.

00:48:42.632 --> 00:48:44.408
Let me in.

00:48:44.432 --> 00:48:46.712
This is not an order.

00:48:48.202 --> 00:48:49.972
It is a request.

00:48:52.172 --> 00:48:54.272
So cold...

00:49:38.402 --> 00:49:41.692
<i>Where did things go wrong?</i>

00:49:49.772 --> 00:49:52.678
<i>It must be because I changed the story</i>

00:49:52.702 --> 00:49:56.522
<i>without knowing my place.</i>

00:49:57.542 --> 00:50:00.388
<i>That's why I must be dying alone</i>

00:50:00.412 --> 00:50:04.172
<i>without anyone finding out.</i>

00:50:06.902 --> 00:50:08.582
Cha Sun Chaek!

00:50:22.072 --> 00:50:23.872
Yi Beon.

00:50:24.752 --> 00:50:26.872
Is that you?

00:50:28.412 --> 00:50:29.882
Yes.

00:50:36.492 --> 00:50:41.108
Am I really dying?

00:50:41.132 --> 00:50:43.552
Die if you can.

00:50:44.582 --> 00:50:47.212
I will chase you to the end.

00:50:48.492 --> 00:50:51.368
I want to live.

00:50:51.392 --> 00:50:53.832
Let me live.

00:51:01.652 --> 00:51:03.392
But

00:51:04.202 --> 00:51:08.498
why are you taking things this far for me?

00:51:08.522 --> 00:51:10.722
For someone like me?

00:51:11.722 --> 00:51:14.152
I have never thought about it,

00:51:15.212 --> 00:51:18.082
but sharing each other's warmth.

00:51:20.582 --> 00:51:22.612
I think

00:51:23.932 --> 00:51:26.012
this must be love.

00:51:46.322 --> 00:51:49.502
<i>Queen Mother is coming in.</i>

00:52:07.632 --> 00:52:10.678
I have not been able to visit you.

00:52:10.702 --> 00:52:12.658
Forgive me, Queen Mother.

00:52:12.682 --> 00:52:15.338
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

00:52:15.362 --> 00:52:19.708
Whoever has more
energy can visit the other.

00:52:19.732 --> 00:52:23.418
This must be something very urgent.

00:52:23.442 --> 00:52:26.278
Since you, who is more youthful than I,

00:52:26.302 --> 00:52:30.368
paid a visit to see me at my chamber.

00:52:30.392 --> 00:52:32.218
I want Prince Gyeongseong's wedding

00:52:32.242 --> 00:52:35.782
to go through a selection process.

00:52:37.522 --> 00:52:42.668
A selection process for
a mere prince's wedding?

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:45.568
He is not just a mere prince.

00:52:45.592 --> 00:52:48.908
It is Prince Gyeongseong,
your favorite prince.

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:53.002
We cannot let him marry just anyone.

00:53:10.382 --> 00:53:13.548
Yes, sounds good.

Of course.

planned by the Internal Court.

00:54:12.742 --> 00:54:15.528
you end up dying, too?

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:19.242
What if we both die?

00:54:20.252 --> 00:54:22.798

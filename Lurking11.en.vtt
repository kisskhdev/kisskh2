00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:33.984
=Episode 11=

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.680
(Nian,)

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:58.320
(I found Song Qian
joined Wei Group three years ago.)

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.359
(He's never left here
or visited Tai City.)

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.080
(One month ago,)

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.920
(after getting engaged to Wei Qing,)

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.079
(he took over Wei Group)

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.680
(as the new executive director.)

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.640
(It seems he climbed up
through marriage.)

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.240
(Could it be)

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.280
(he's really not K?)

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:25.280
Qian,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.319
do you know that female doctor
from today?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.359
How would I know her?

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.319
Could it be that you forgot her

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.239
after losing your memory?

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.959
I'm worried

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.959
if she discovers
your identity in Tai City,

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.480
she might become a threat to you.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.560
We should eliminate her early.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:52.920
She's just a doctor.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.200
She can't threaten me.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.480
Then don't see her again.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.799
She seems like a troublemaker.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.559
Okay.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.879
It's too late today.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.719
I'll have Zheng take you back.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.479
I'm not going back.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.199
I absolutely won't go back tonight.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.719
I'm your fiancee.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.319
Yet you still haven't touched me.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.879
I was injured before.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.279
You know that.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.479
I haven't fully recovered.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.840
I don't care.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.400
I'm staying here tonight.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.879
Be good.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.159
Your brother and I
have matters to handle.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.360
Zheng,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.599
take Miss Wei home first.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.719
Yes.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:20.719
Gu Nian

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.960
got the dean's phone.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.400
We must get rid of her immediately.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.400
(Nian,)

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.400
(I've unlocked
the dean's phone gallery.)

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.680
(Wei Group?)

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.479
(These photos
were important enough to encrypt.)

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.319
Could it be

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.960
the dean's death
is related to the Wei Group?

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.240
Dr. Gu, please wait here for a moment.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.560
Our representative will arrive shortly.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.240
Okay, thank you.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.200
You're welcome.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.800
(What exactly is in the photos?)

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.719
(The background looks
like Wei Group's warehouse.)

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.519
(But how do I find it?)

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.320
Dr. Gu.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.560
I didn't expect this.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.519
Mr. Song?

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.639
We meet again.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.480
You're the person
in charge of the project?

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.399
Is that surprising?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.439
May our collaboration go well.

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:48.959
May it go well.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.879
Let's conclude
this morning's discussion.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.800
Meeting adjourned.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.079
- Okay, Mr. Song.
- Okay.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:09.919
Dr. Gu,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
have lunch together?

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm sorry.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.079
I already have plans.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560
It's getting late.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:20.839
I'll take my leave now.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.000
Am I that intimidating?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.880
Dr. Gu,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.639
just days ago you were clinging to me.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.040
Now you're avoiding me.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.880
Mr. Song,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.720
I think you've misunderstood.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.360
We're simply business partners.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.920
No clinging ever occurred.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.320
Nian.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.560
Senior?

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.600
Dr. Gu, this gentleman
is here to see you.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.920
What brings you here?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.360
I'm here to take you to lunch.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.480
Okay, I'm ready to go now.

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:13.839
Mr. Song, we are leaving now.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.040
Won't you introduce us?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.279
This is our hospital's psychiatrist,

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.119
Dr. Zhou.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.319
This is Mr. Song from Wei Group.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.239
Hello,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.400
Mr. Song.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:30.639
Heading out for lunch?

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:34.360
Then we're leaving, Mr. Song.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.160
Okay. Let's all have lunch together.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.399
I need to consult with you
about something, Dr. Zhou.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.320
Sure.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.320
Excuse me.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.000
What would you like?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.072
- You decide.
- You decide.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.360
Would you like
to try our couple's set meal?

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:18.919
We are three.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.839
Three people can still order it.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.319
I'll take one.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.279
Make it two.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.240
Alright, please wait.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Where is Mr. Song?

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.000
He went out to eat with Dr. Gu.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.800
Dr. Gu?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.400
Gu Nian?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.760
Miss,

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.720
I'll take my leave

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.759
if there's nothing else.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.680
Song Qian, You dare lie to me!

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:04.719
Nian,

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:07.040
have a shrimp.
It's good for your health.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.439
You two seem very close.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.199
Of course we're close.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.360
Nian's mother entrusted her to me.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.040
I'll naturally take care
of her for a lifetime.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.759
By the way, Mr. Song.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.240
Weren't you consulting me?

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.759
I want to ask how
to treat amnesia if I got it.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.039
(Amnesia?)

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:48.480
Then you'd need to get an examination
at the hospital first.

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.200
Then I'll offer a treatment plan.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.279
Thank you for your help.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.799
You're Nian's friend.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.080
You're welcome.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.440
Still, thank you.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.120
Eat more. It's good for your eyes.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.919
Mr. Song, you don't like mangoes?

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.200
I'm allergic to mangoes.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.519
You eat.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.912
I'm allergic to mangoes.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:23.599
Nian,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.800
what's wrong?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.800
I'm leaving now.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.720
I need to sort documents.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.840
Nian,

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.320
I'll go with you.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.440
No need.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.919
What a coincidence.
I don't like mangoes either.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:04.639
(Is it a coincidence?)

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.120
(He's also allergic to mangoes.)

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:10.519
I want to ask how
to treat amnesia if I got it.

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:12.399
(Does he have amnesia?)

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:14.279
(But there's no scar on his shoulder.)

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.240
(And he's never been to Tai City.)

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.440
Which floor?

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:19.519
The warehouse.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.399
Me too.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.960
Let's go together.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.279
(Warehouse?)

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.120
Where are all the boxes from the photos?

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:08.799
Why did the power go out?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.320
Who's there?

[The animal scenes were staged, in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:18.687
What I fear is

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:22.077
the sadness my lover will feel

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:25.567
after hearing about my death.

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:28.313
<i>In any situation,</i>

00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:30.913
<i>these bracelets will connect us together.</i>

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:35.077
<i>Consider it a token of my affection
before the wedding.</i>

00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:43.543
W-Why are you not killing me?

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.173
This is humiliating.

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:47.767
Just kill me!

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:52.287
Because.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:56.547
I promised not to take anyone's life

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:00.967
with this sword.

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.797
<i>Because we weren't
destined to be apart yet,</i>

[Episode 12: The
reencounter with the world]

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:16.503
We took care of the Chief State Minister,

00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:18.553
but until the abdication
process is completed,

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:21.573
we cannot ignore the opposition's movement.

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:25.003
Are you suggesting
using the military force?

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:27.943
It was Prince Seonghyeon's idea, not mine.

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:31.313
Shedding more blood
when we achieved our goal

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:34.993
is no different than what
His Majesty did a decade ago.

00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:39.273
I thought our great cause was
to create a different world.

00:03:39.297 --> 00:03:41.963
What a dangerous comment.

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:45.023
We do not have time to get sentimental.

00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:49.247
We must eliminate potential resistance,
as Prince Seonghyeon ordered.

00:03:52.727 --> 00:03:55.883
With the Hongmungwan official
Jung Su Gyeom's lead,

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:57.743
the officials of three ministries and.

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:00.567
Confucian scholars are heading
to the King's Palace.

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:05.547
Jung Su Gyeom, you said?

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:07.953
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:11.717
Please withdraw your abdication!

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:16.223
Your Majesty, the abdication was
planned by an evil force

00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:19.313
that is trying to shake
the country's foundation.

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:23.903
Why do you play ignorant
of Prince Seonghyeon's impure ambition?

00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:26.693
Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.

00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:30.797
<i>Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.</i>

00:04:55.777 --> 00:04:57.737
Catch her!

00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:36.813
But your foolish decision is

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:40.407
hastening your death in the end.

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:49.377
It is finally time to go, Sun Chaek.

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:43.077
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:47.517
Catch that bastard.

00:06:49.587 --> 00:06:52.037
Catch him, I said!

00:06:57.327 --> 00:06:59.333
If you want to live,

00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:02.457
drop the sword and step aside now!

00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.573
Prince Gyeongseong,

00:08:05.597 --> 00:08:08.047
how are you back here?

00:08:17.907 --> 00:08:20.183
How dare you bandits

00:08:20.207 --> 00:08:22.703
come inside the Palace?

00:08:22.727 --> 00:08:25.203
We were ordered to kill anyone

00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:28.227
who goes against the King.

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:33.657
Is this

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:37.297
truly what His Majesty wants?

00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:42.157
Step back if you do not want to get hurt.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:47.237
Stop!

00:08:57.497 --> 00:08:59.513
Are you all right, Sir?

00:08:59.537 --> 00:09:00.923
What are you doing here?

00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:02.493
It was Prince Gyeongseong's order.

00:09:02.517 --> 00:09:06.333
Prince Gyeongseong has returned.

00:09:06.357 --> 00:09:08.387
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:22.397
What is taking him so long?

00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:29.083
I will stop by somewhere briefly.

00:09:29.107 --> 00:09:31.803
Prince Seonghyeon will be here soon.

00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:33.163
Where are you going?

00:09:33.187 --> 00:09:36.103
Because your son is facing trouble,

00:09:36.127 --> 00:09:39.147
you are not going to him, are you?

00:09:40.177 --> 00:09:43.503
The Chief Secretary
cannot even handle his son.

00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:46.923
If Prince Seonghyeon found out,
he will not be able to live

00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:48.863
even if he is the Chief Secretary's son.

00:09:48.887 --> 00:09:50.623
Say that again!

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:52.177
Your Excellency.

00:09:54.147 --> 00:09:56.037
I think he is here.

00:10:00.407 --> 00:10:02.917
Arrest everyone!

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:19.363
Thanks to you, I took
a nice trip to the border.

00:10:19.387 --> 00:10:20.793
What the hell are you saying?

00:10:20.817 --> 00:10:22.883
You said even sworn enemies

00:10:22.907 --> 00:10:26.387
should greet each other properly.

00:10:27.997 --> 00:10:31.087
Are you mocking me right now?

00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:40.223
I no longer have any guilt or empathy

00:10:40.247 --> 00:10:44.157
for you because of the past.

00:10:46.577 --> 00:10:48.537
Soldiers!

00:10:53.307 --> 00:10:56.003
Take this traitor away!

00:10:56.027 --> 00:10:57.683
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:10:57.707 --> 00:10:59.113
Let go.

00:10:59.137 --> 00:11:01.243
Let go. Let go of me.

00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.043
How dare you!

00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:04.583
Prince Gyeongseong, you bastard.

00:11:04.607 --> 00:11:07.073
Let go! Let go of me!

00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:08.663
Let go!

00:11:08.687 --> 00:11:10.783
Let go, you bastards!

00:11:10.807 --> 00:11:13.287
Let go. Let go!

00:11:21.337 --> 00:11:23.387
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:33.387
It really is you, right?

00:11:34.337 --> 00:11:36.557
This isn't a dream, right?

00:11:43.947 --> 00:11:48.523
I came to believe in miracles.

00:11:48.547 --> 00:11:50.997
I knew you'd come back.

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:55.627
Thank you for staying alive.

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:06.277
What took you so long?

00:12:10.587 --> 00:12:14.433
It is not fun if the male lead
comes back too easily.

We are okay now.

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:51.577
You went through a lot because
of your foolish father.

00:12:53.157 --> 00:12:54.913
Thank you.

00:12:54.937 --> 00:12:56.853
I am sorry about what you went through.

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:58.663
Are you all right?

00:12:58.687 --> 00:13:03.413
I am so happy to see
that everyone is all right.

00:13:03.437 --> 00:13:06.223
We are basically a family now.

00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:08.307
That is right. Yes.

00:13:10.637 --> 00:13:12.713
Let us have you return home.

00:13:12.737 --> 00:13:14.493
Home... Home...

00:13:14.517 --> 00:13:16.557
Let us go.

00:13:19.037 --> 00:13:20.983
Go home and wait for me.

00:13:21.007 --> 00:13:23.083
Where are you going now?

00:13:23.107 --> 00:13:25.047
I need to stop by somewhere.

00:13:26.947 --> 00:13:28.747
I need to see this through.

00:13:41.147 --> 00:13:42.697
Your Majesty.

00:13:44.007 --> 00:13:46.237
Bring a physician!

00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:58.327
Will he recover?

00:13:59.327 --> 00:14:03.753
He was exposed to highly toxic
incense for a long time.

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:08.327
It will take a long time for him
to detox completely.

00:14:10.227 --> 00:14:11.887
Your Majesty.

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:16.397
Are you awake?

00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:23.287
I am sure they said you were dead.

00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:26.083
Are you back as a ghost?

00:14:26.107 --> 00:14:29.867
I almost died, but I made it back alive.

00:14:34.357 --> 00:14:37.503
I cannot believe it. I cannot.

00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:42.133
You resented me in the past.

00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:47.763
That is why you are visiting me
even after your death. You!

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:49.427
Your Majesty.

Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:12.723
I am sorry.

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.203
I am sorry.

00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:16.673
I-I am sorry.

00:15:16.697 --> 00:15:19.817
I... I

00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:25.243
I took your mother's life away

00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:27.873
and I put

00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:31.103
blood on your hands. I did.

00:15:31.127 --> 00:15:32.803
I am sorry.

00:15:32.827 --> 00:15:36.133
Please... Please spare me this once.

00:15:36.157 --> 00:15:38.803
P-Please spare me this once.

00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:41.373
T-This once.

00:15:41.397 --> 00:15:43.017
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:15:44.017 --> 00:15:46.013
<i>Spare him.</i>

<i>I will do anything you
want me to do, Uncle.</i>

<i>Please. Please spare him this once.</i>

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:55.483
Spare me this once, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:15:55.507 --> 00:16:00.027
This once. Spare me this once.

00:16:16.587 --> 00:16:18.843
Where are you going in such a hurry?

00:16:18.867 --> 00:16:22.297
Are you running away by chance?

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:27.803
What are you saying?

00:16:27.827 --> 00:16:30.237
What else could I be saying?

00:16:40.307 --> 00:16:42.927
- Arrest her.
- Yes, sir.

00:16:44.277 --> 00:16:47.443
Let go of me! Let go of me!

00:16:47.467 --> 00:16:48.923
Let go! Let go!

00:16:48.947 --> 00:16:51.533
Do Hwa Seon! Do Hwa Seon!

00:16:51.557 --> 00:16:55.073
Let go of me! I did nothing wrong!

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:57.133
Let go of me!

00:16:57.157 --> 00:17:00.857
- Do Hwa Seon, you...
- She's still talking down to me.

00:17:00.907 --> 00:17:02.443
Bye.

00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:04.357
Let go!

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.833
I-I think there is a misunderstanding.

00:17:15.857 --> 00:17:18.733
This is a misunderstanding!

00:17:18.757 --> 00:17:22.957
Prince Seonghyeon. Please
bring Prince Seonghyeon!

00:17:44.457 --> 00:17:48.933
Because of old grudges from the past,

00:17:48.957 --> 00:17:52.267
I also have not been able to look
upon the King favorably.

00:17:53.297 --> 00:17:57.373
I have no choice, even if you call me
an old lady in the back room.

00:17:57.397 --> 00:18:00.123
But seeing the bloodshed
in the Palace again,

00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:03.547
I need to make a decision.

00:18:05.757 --> 00:18:09.093
For the sake of the country in crisis,

00:18:09.117 --> 00:18:12.397
and the faltering King,

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:21.883
I want you to step up, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:26.487
I will also contribute the support
needed for that process.

00:18:49.847 --> 00:18:53.003
<i>Can I dare ask you to be my friend?</i>

00:18:53.027 --> 00:18:55.363
<i>I would like to see you often.</i>

00:18:55.387 --> 00:18:57.653
<i>It feels like a dream.</i>

00:18:57.677 --> 00:19:00.287
<i>I have a friend now.</i>

00:19:20.697 --> 00:19:24.373
Make it quick if you have something to say.

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:26.887
For a very long time,

00:19:28.377 --> 00:19:31.243
I've been fond of you.

00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:33.643
Because

00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:36.887
you were my shining female lead.

00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:42.183
<i>I thought I had no one,</i>

00:19:42.207 --> 00:19:44.747
<i>but I had made a true friend.</i>

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:50.247
So, I was happy.

00:19:51.247 --> 00:19:55.307
You are determined to
turn me into a bad person.

00:19:59.897 --> 00:20:02.823
That is your problem, My Lady.

00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:06.763
You only care about your feelings,
and you cannot read the air.

00:20:06.787 --> 00:20:11.033
Yes, because I can't read the air,

00:20:11.057 --> 00:20:15.003
I really believed you
wanted to be my friend.

00:20:15.027 --> 00:20:17.683
I was happy and

00:20:17.707 --> 00:20:21.177
I had opened up to you about things
I couldn't with no one else.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:24.517
And I was nosy for no reason.

00:20:26.307 --> 00:20:28.107
And then.

00:20:29.237 --> 00:20:31.807
I almost drowned to death.

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:36.427
I thought someone else was the culprit

00:20:38.627 --> 00:20:41.523
and got kidnapped without anyone
knowing and almost died.

00:20:41.547 --> 00:20:45.037
You kept surviving amazingly every time.

00:20:48.787 --> 00:20:50.573
Since when

00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:53.583
did you change so much?

00:20:53.607 --> 00:20:56.463
You haven't always been like this.

00:20:56.487 --> 00:20:59.623
I never changed.

00:20:59.647 --> 00:21:03.023
I have always been the same. But

00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:07.557
I changed things up since
you barged into my life.

00:21:09.187 --> 00:21:11.687
It was my fault in the end.

00:21:14.177 --> 00:21:16.153
I'm sorry,

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:18.817
for barging into your story.

00:21:21.437 --> 00:21:27.533
But hurting others is never acceptable
under any circumstances.

00:21:27.557 --> 00:21:31.683
Please admit your wrongdoing and stop now.

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:35.073
Why should I stop?

00:21:35.097 --> 00:21:39.513
As I watched you easily achieve
something that requires a lifetime effort

00:21:39.537 --> 00:21:41.877
with a smile,

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:44.733
do you know how miserable I felt?

00:21:44.757 --> 00:21:48.973
You're wrong. Not a single
moment was easy for me.

00:21:48.997 --> 00:21:52.893
Do you only pity yourself and
think others have it easy?

00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:54.523
Do not try to lecture me.

00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:58.147
Someone who tries to
hurt others out of envy

00:21:59.147 --> 00:22:01.977
doesn't deserve to be the lead character.

00:22:05.037 --> 00:22:11.167
Because you'll no longer be
cheered on by the people you love.

00:22:23.047 --> 00:22:25.343
Why do you...

00:22:25.367 --> 00:22:27.457
Why do you keep

00:22:28.337 --> 00:22:31.317
saying such strange things?

00:22:32.337 --> 00:22:34.553
Might as well strangle me or kill me.

00:22:34.577 --> 00:22:37.397
Just make up your mind!

00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:07.021
Confess what you tried to do

00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:10.821
by forming the Heuksa Clan!

00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:13.051
Heuksa Clan?

00:23:13.075 --> 00:23:15.321
What are you talking about?

00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:20.995
You are the one who mocked
and deceived His Majesty!

00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:36.451
Ever so kindly, this man whom you sent

00:23:36.475 --> 00:23:38.461
confessed to everything.

00:23:38.485 --> 00:23:40.601
My Lord,

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:42.401
my apologies.

00:23:42.425 --> 00:23:44.271
I do not know him.

00:23:44.295 --> 00:23:46.031
My Lord.

00:23:46.055 --> 00:23:48.131
Come on.

00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:51.101
Why are you trying to frame me like this?

00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:53.751
You dare cast out a man who
sacrificed himself for your cause?

00:23:53.775 --> 00:23:57.491
What right do you have
to stand up there and ask?

00:23:57.515 --> 00:24:00.075
<i>I told him to do it.</i>

00:24:18.775 --> 00:24:24.781
This is why you tried to
cover my eyes and ears.

00:24:24.805 --> 00:24:27.485
The ones who had a deep and dark desire

00:24:27.555 --> 00:24:32.131
to betray me by my side
for a long time were...

00:24:32.155 --> 00:24:34.955
You bastards were the ones.

00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:42.971
However, if you confess to your crime now,

00:24:42.995 --> 00:24:46.591
for the first and last time,

00:24:46.615 --> 00:24:49.441
I will spare your life.

00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:55.025
I will not punish your children, either.

00:24:59.705 --> 00:25:01.671
Your Majesty,

00:25:01.695 --> 00:25:03.911
I fell for Prince Seonghyeon's sweet talk

00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:06.961
and committed an unforgivable sin.

00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:09.761
Please kill me.

00:25:09.785 --> 00:25:14.841
I also foolishly participated
in achieving the wrong cause.

00:25:14.865 --> 00:25:19.841
Prince Seonghyeon also framed
the Chief State Minister for treason.

00:25:19.865 --> 00:25:21.751
He is right.

00:25:21.775 --> 00:25:24.001
He tried to cut out Your Majesty's

00:25:24.025 --> 00:25:27.901
eyes, ears, hands, and feet.

00:25:27.925 --> 00:25:30.721
Please kill me.

00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:34.151
<i>Please kill us.</i>

00:25:34.175 --> 00:25:38.971
I should behead all of you

00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:42.391
and destroy three
generations of your families,

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:44.991
but since the leader was revealed,

00:25:45.015 --> 00:25:47.001
I will keep my promise.

00:25:47.025 --> 00:25:51.981
However, other than
your lives being spared,

00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:56.995
do not expect to be forgiven in other ways.

00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:02.245
How despicable.

00:26:03.255 --> 00:26:06.195
Who is forgiving whom?

00:26:06.995 --> 00:26:10.331
You took the throne by killing your family.

00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:13.075
Did you expect to become a sage king?

00:26:13.925 --> 00:26:18.181
You are not a king. You are an animal!

00:26:18.205 --> 00:26:20.985
You bastard!

00:26:31.275 --> 00:26:33.051
This bastard...

00:26:33.075 --> 00:26:35.151
Cut his head off immediately.

00:26:35.175 --> 00:26:36.875
Right now!

00:26:40.595 --> 00:26:42.495
What are you doing?

00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:51.851
I cannot follow that order, Your Majesty.

00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:53.471
What?

00:26:53.495 --> 00:26:58.531
Please do not repeat the same wrongdoing.

00:26:58.555 --> 00:27:01.151
One's nature never changes.

00:27:01.175 --> 00:27:04.331
You expect an animal to forgive?

00:27:04.355 --> 00:27:07.775
A dog passing by would laugh.

00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:19.141
You bastard. You bastard!

00:27:19.165 --> 00:27:21.091
You cannot, Your Majesty! You cannot.

00:27:21.115 --> 00:27:23.061
Get out of the way!

00:27:23.085 --> 00:27:25.691
Move. I will kill that bastard.

00:27:25.715 --> 00:27:28.065
After you took the throne that way,

00:27:28.965 --> 00:27:32.045
have you felt at peace even for a day?

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.831
Once your life is stained in blood,

00:27:38.855 --> 00:27:43.065
you cannot go back. I
know it better than anyone.

00:27:45.065 --> 00:27:47.571
Even if you struggle your whole life,

00:27:47.595 --> 00:27:50.745
it's a shackle you cannot escape!

00:27:54.035 --> 00:27:58.935
It will create another grudge that
will come back to haunt you.

00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:09.391
Please end the cycle now

00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:12.055
and only look ahead, Your Majesty.

00:28:13.065 --> 00:28:17.385
Please sleep soundly,
even for a day, Your Majesty!

00:28:38.705 --> 00:28:40.805
Take care of the rest

00:28:41.935 --> 00:28:44.185
however you want, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:28:56.855 --> 00:28:59.441
Where are you running off to?

00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:01.381
I am not done talking!

00:29:01.405 --> 00:29:02.951
You bastard!

00:29:02.975 --> 00:29:06.901
I will rip him apart and kill him...

00:29:06.925 --> 00:29:09.211
Let go. Let go of me.

00:29:09.235 --> 00:29:10.661
Stop right there!

00:29:10.685 --> 00:29:14.671
I need to tear that bastard apart.

00:29:14.695 --> 00:29:17.301
Everything is over.

00:29:17.325 --> 00:29:22.351
Do you want to live and
die as his hunting dog?

00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:26.795
That is what I chose to do.

00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:33.541
You must pay for your choice as well.

00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:35.405
It is unfair.

00:29:36.145 --> 00:29:38.971
How could this world be like this?

00:29:38.995 --> 00:29:41.911
I will rip all of you apart!

00:29:41.935 --> 00:29:45.585
Let go! Let go! You bastards!

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:50.495
Let go! You bastards...

00:30:17.175 --> 00:30:19.325
Go on and walk by.

00:30:20.415 --> 00:30:23.005
Take me away now!

00:30:25.235 --> 00:30:27.731
Someone told me

00:30:27.755 --> 00:30:30.041
that revenge is,

00:30:30.065 --> 00:30:33.445
for the ones who cannot go back.

00:30:35.405 --> 00:30:39.405
That means you have a chance.

00:30:40.245 --> 00:30:43.795
A chance to turn your life around again.

00:30:46.535 --> 00:30:48.385
I thought.

00:30:49.665 --> 00:30:51.865
I should tell you this.

00:31:12.085 --> 00:31:14.115
Hold on.

00:31:16.505 --> 00:31:19.145
I came to tell you something.

00:31:22.825 --> 00:31:27.175
Please tell Prince Seonghyeon this.

00:31:29.395 --> 00:31:32.811
"I understand your resentment.

00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:38.181
But do not become like the one you hate."

00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:41.671
I want you to move on from the past

00:31:41.695 --> 00:31:44.475
and find a new life.

00:31:46.215 --> 00:31:49.105
I hope my sincerity reaches you.

00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:55.315
At least, I can tell you do not mean it.

00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:58.361
"Gumaengjusan."

00:31:58.385 --> 00:32:01.275
I did not say that saying to you.

00:32:02.235 --> 00:32:04.735
You said it to me.

00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:09.655
Tell the actual person who told me that.

00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:13.435
"This is not the end of me.

00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:16.875
I will make sure to come back."

00:32:18.315 --> 00:32:19.895
Tell her that.

00:32:52.235 --> 00:32:53.991
What a nice day,

00:32:54.015 --> 00:32:55.985
Lady Sun Chaek.

00:33:11.845 --> 00:33:14.291
You proved yourself to be a true fan.

00:33:14.315 --> 00:33:15.771
I admit it.

00:33:15.795 --> 00:33:18.411
Thank you for giving me the chance.

00:33:18.435 --> 00:33:23.621
Are you sure you won't regret staying here?

00:33:23.645 --> 00:33:26.141
Even if you reach the ending

00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:28.685
and this world ends?

00:34:07.665 --> 00:34:09.531
What do you think?

00:34:09.555 --> 00:34:11.355
Do you like it?

00:34:13.525 --> 00:34:17.955
It seems like spring has arrived
in Hoseondang, Wife.

00:34:18.895 --> 00:34:21.451
Why do you talk like that?

00:34:21.475 --> 00:34:26.565
And "Wife"? Calling me that.

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:31.251
I love it so much,

00:34:31.275 --> 00:34:33.325
Dear Husband.

00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:45.171
We should have a wedding
before spring comes.

00:34:45.195 --> 00:34:47.551
- Wedding?
- Yes.

00:34:47.575 --> 00:34:51.315
We need to announce that
we are officially married.

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:54.831
- If we rush it, we can-
- Hold on.

00:34:54.855 --> 00:35:00.271
Don't you think the wedding could wait?

00:35:00.295 --> 00:35:03.001
Is there an issue?

00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:05.241
<i>The ending.</i>

00:35:05.265 --> 00:35:07.481
<i>Everything concludes</i>

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.875
<i>when you reach the ending.</i>

00:35:11.005 --> 00:35:12.995
To be honest,

00:35:13.765 --> 00:35:15.911
there's something I didn't get to tell you.

00:35:15.935 --> 00:35:18.141
Do you have a secret lover?

00:35:18.165 --> 00:35:21.571
Or a secret child?

00:35:21.595 --> 00:35:23.341
I do not care about things like that.

00:35:23.365 --> 00:35:26.615
N-No, it's not like that.

00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:33.105
It's something even more unbelievable.

00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:46.945
What is it, Father?

00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:05.231
You will be repenting your
wrongdoings starting now.

00:36:05.255 --> 00:36:07.885
Please straighten your back.

00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:13.955
- Gosh...
- Father, do it properly.

00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:18.751
You know I have a bad back.

00:36:18.775 --> 00:36:23.895
You will start the silence training, too.

00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:27.801
You are being too harsh to your father.

00:36:27.825 --> 00:36:30.781
Who do you think I take after?

00:36:30.805 --> 00:36:34.695
You lost your composure.
We will start all over.

00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:49.845
[Do not enter.

00:36:51.035 --> 00:36:55.955
I am back to being alone with nothing.

00:37:12.005 --> 00:37:15.325
I hope we catch 10 sea bream.

00:37:16.875 --> 00:37:19.645
Sea bream is not in season.

00:37:20.485 --> 00:37:22.721
I-Is that so?

00:37:22.745 --> 00:37:26.965
What would you like to catch, then?

00:37:28.565 --> 00:37:32.215
I want to catch crayfish and cry.

00:37:35.905 --> 00:37:38.455
Cray. Cry.

00:38:12.655 --> 00:38:16.705
<i>So, we are inside a novel,</i>

00:38:24.545 --> 00:38:27.681
you came from a different world,

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:30.301
and if this story ends,

00:38:30.325 --> 00:38:32.795
this world will disappear?

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:35.395
Yes.

00:38:36.505 --> 00:38:39.451
And romance novels like this

00:38:39.475 --> 00:38:42.041
usually end when the lead characters marry.

00:38:42.065 --> 00:38:45.841
That is the reason you
want to delay the wedding?

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:49.025
To prevent this world from disappearing?

00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:02.395
Do you expect me to believe that?

00:39:05.365 --> 00:39:08.111
I know it's hard to believe.

00:39:08.135 --> 00:39:10.405
But it's true.

00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:14.901
I want to be with you forever.

00:39:14.925 --> 00:39:18.361
But I'm afraid that decision will result

00:39:18.385 --> 00:39:22.465
in this world disappearing
and tear us apart.

00:39:39.185 --> 00:39:42.445
Whether you are the real
Cha Sun Chaek or not,

00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:45.685
I do not care.

00:39:49.915 --> 00:39:52.781
<i>Because you captured my heart</i>

00:39:52.805 --> 00:39:55.591
<i>by being audacious like no one else,</i>

00:39:55.615 --> 00:39:59.095
<i>my life completely changed.</i>

00:39:59.915 --> 00:40:03.201
<i>Through you, I realized fate is</i>

00:40:03.225 --> 00:40:05.935
<i>a miracle created by strong desires.</i>

00:40:06.815 --> 00:40:09.951
<i>- No!
- Move!</i>

00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:13.615
<i>I put my life that felt like
a punishment behind me</i>

00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:18.255
<i>and started to dream of my future with you.</i>

00:40:19.525 --> 00:40:25.495
<i>All of this was possible
because you came to me.</i>

00:40:26.595 --> 00:40:28.865
<i>You saved me,</i>

00:40:30.035 --> 00:40:32.035
<i>and changed me.</i>

00:40:37.555 --> 00:40:39.741
So, from now on,

00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:42.115
my trust and common sense

00:40:43.105 --> 00:40:46.095
only dwell with you
standing in front of me.

00:40:47.505 --> 00:40:49.231
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:40:49.255 --> 00:40:51.885
Even if this world disappears,

00:40:53.465 --> 00:40:56.831
I choose to be with you.

00:40:56.855 --> 00:41:00.951
If I can be with you,

00:41:00.975 --> 00:41:04.695
I won't be afraid even if everything ends.

00:41:06.075 --> 00:41:08.255
At this very moment,

00:41:10.265 --> 00:41:13.865
I'll only look at you,
my most precious one.

00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:29.971

00:41:29.995 --> 00:41:32.831

<i>Wedding gift for sale!</i>

Aigoo, no one here
wants to buy a wedding gift.

00:41:41.445 --> 00:41:44.085
Should we go to another house?

00:41:45.025 --> 00:41:47.281
Wedding gift for sale!

00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:50.705
<i>Wedding gift for sale!</i>

You made it. Please come inside.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:58.545
We have some hot meat and delicious wine.

00:41:59.515 --> 00:42:03.311
I already had plenty of meat and wine.

00:42:03.335 --> 00:42:04.901
What are you doing?

00:42:04.925 --> 00:42:06.691
Lay out the straw mat.

00:42:06.715 --> 00:42:08.325
Yes.

00:42:10.505 --> 00:42:14.211
All right, all right.
Since we want to digest,

00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:17.391
let us lie down here

00:42:17.415 --> 00:42:19.641
and rest a bit.

00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:22.145
Aigoo, sit down, sit down.

00:42:23.175 --> 00:42:25.531
Come on now.

00:42:25.555 --> 00:42:28.665
It is better to lie down inside.

00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:31.591
Gosh, brothers!

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:34.141
Please use your muscles.

00:42:34.165 --> 00:42:35.501
I know.

00:42:35.525 --> 00:42:38.041
Use your head if you do not have muscles.

00:42:38.065 --> 00:42:41.251
What if I can't get married
because of my brothers?

00:42:41.275 --> 00:42:42.521
That cannot be.

00:42:42.545 --> 00:42:43.941
Father, Father.

00:42:43.965 --> 00:42:46.381
The gift carrier needs to come in.

00:42:46.405 --> 00:42:49.561
This will take all night at this rate.

00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:51.021
Father.

00:42:51.045 --> 00:42:53.961
We need our secret weapon.

00:42:53.985 --> 00:42:56.175
Secret weapon?

00:42:58.155 --> 00:42:59.945
No, no...

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.505
Father.

00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:05.965
Please.

00:43:12.415 --> 00:43:15.701
Come inside now.

00:43:15.725 --> 00:43:20.141
The Cha family had
this wine for generations.

00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:25.125
It is a 30-year-old mountain ginseng wine.

00:43:27.285 --> 00:43:29.535
M-Mountain ginseng...

00:43:33.855 --> 00:43:38.615
W-We will not be tricked
by a mountain ginseng wine.

00:43:42.645 --> 00:43:43.771
How about

00:43:43.795 --> 00:43:49.301
a cocktail made with mountain ginseng wine?

00:43:49.325 --> 00:43:50.465
Cocktail?

00:43:50.555 --> 00:43:54.755
If you come inside, you will be able to try

00:43:54.785 --> 00:43:58.915
the famous cocktail immediately.

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:05.805
C-Cocktail? M-Me?

00:44:07.265 --> 00:44:11.201
Yes, yes. I-I am coming. Cocktail...

00:44:11.225 --> 00:44:14.611
Yes, let us go in. Let us go.

00:44:14.635 --> 00:44:16.915
Come on in.

00:44:20.315 --> 00:44:24.011
For Prince Gyeongseong and
Cha Sun Chaek to live happily ever after

00:44:24.035 --> 00:44:27.011
and for everyone's longevity.

00:44:27.035 --> 00:44:28.681
Cheers!

00:44:28.705 --> 00:44:31.711
<i>Cheers!</i>

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:35.741
We will create a wave
starting from the right.

00:44:35.765 --> 00:44:39.121
If anyone refuses to do it,

00:44:39.145 --> 00:44:41.611
we will start from the top.

00:44:41.635 --> 00:44:44.495
All right. Start.

00:45:08.575 --> 00:45:11.931
<i>♫ I thought I was dreaming,
you shined like a shooting star ♫</i>

00:45:11.955 --> 00:45:14.461
<i>♫ Daydream is like a fairytale ♫</i>

00:45:14.485 --> 00:45:17.385
All right. Let us start.

00:45:19.695 --> 00:45:22.331
Brother-in-law, I have no ill feelings.

00:45:22.355 --> 00:45:25.711
This is good for your vitality.

00:45:25.735 --> 00:45:27.171
First beating!

00:45:27.195 --> 00:45:29.255
First beating!

00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:34.681
This is good for blood circulation.

00:45:34.705 --> 00:45:36.321
Second beating!

00:45:36.345 --> 00:45:37.631
No...

00:45:37.655 --> 00:45:39.671
- Gosh.
- Go easy. Easy.

00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:42.891
This opens your eyes wide.

00:45:42.915 --> 00:45:44.361
Third beating!

00:45:44.385 --> 00:45:47.351
Third beating!

00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:50.805
We will beat you as much as we love you.

00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:05.291
Stop beating him, brothers!

00:46:05.315 --> 00:46:07.081
He barely managed to make it back alive.

00:46:07.105 --> 00:46:10.121
What if he dies again?

00:46:10.145 --> 00:46:13.361
Sun Chaek, sit back just for today.

00:46:13.385 --> 00:46:14.731
Yes, Sun Chaek.

00:46:14.755 --> 00:46:18.531
This is good for your husband.

00:46:18.555 --> 00:46:21.841
Sun Chaek, people do not die so easily.

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:24.605
Do you really think so?

00:46:25.605 --> 00:46:29.261
You beat me 35 times in total so far.

00:46:29.285 --> 00:46:33.031
Have you been keeping count?

00:46:33.055 --> 00:46:35.191
The more you hit me,

00:46:35.215 --> 00:46:39.165
the more you will see me privately.

00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:44.561
I plan to live a long life, thanks to you.

00:46:44.585 --> 00:46:49.561
Let us meet up often... often

00:46:49.585 --> 00:46:53.445
often for a long time.

00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:57.025
What are you doing? Put him down.

00:46:58.765 --> 00:47:00.815
Does it hurt a lot?

00:47:07.808 --> 00:47:10.048
You know, Prince Seonghyeon.

00:47:12.078 --> 00:47:14.964
I heard the boat he was on

00:47:14.988 --> 00:47:19.098
headed for exile caught
in a storm and sank.

00:47:25.668 --> 00:47:28.064
That also

00:47:28.088 --> 00:47:31.218
must be the ending Prince Seonghyeon chose.

00:47:33.358 --> 00:47:37.914
What do you think my
ending would be like, then?

00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:42.498
After seeing how you made a big
decision regarding Prince Seonghyeon,

00:47:43.478 --> 00:47:48.688
I became curious about
the world you will create.

00:48:19.738 --> 00:48:21.844
However

00:48:21.868 --> 00:48:25.244
I will put down that sword

00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:27.498
going forward.

00:48:37.278 --> 00:48:42.358
I am not sure if I have
told you this before.

00:48:46.618 --> 00:48:52.964
I inflicted an unbearable
wound on you as a child.

00:48:52.988 --> 00:48:55.138
I am truly sorry.

00:48:56.178 --> 00:48:58.748
This is my apology as your uncle.

00:49:51.838 --> 00:49:53.824
So pretty.

00:49:53.848 --> 00:49:55.174
My Lady!

00:49:55.198 --> 00:49:58.048
My Lady is so pretty.

00:50:04.228 --> 00:50:06.278
So pretty.

00:50:15.148 --> 00:50:17.098
So beautiful!

00:50:30.408 --> 00:50:32.138
So handsome...

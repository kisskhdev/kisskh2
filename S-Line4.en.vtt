《S LINE》 (A red line connecting people who have had sex)

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.110
So sex...

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.120
wrong

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.100
There is a red line connecting people who have had sex.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.570
So if you wear these glasses, you can see those red lines.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.860
You can see those red lines when you are born

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.090
Hello

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.640
This is too outrageous.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.310
You high school students

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.420
I know you are fearless

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.530
I&amp;#39;m a criminal police officer.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.210
Don&amp;#39;t underestimate the detective

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.530
I knew you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe it.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.920
Wait a moment…

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
I never said I don&amp;#39;t believe you.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.700
So you mean

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.250
After someone took Sun Ah&amp;#39;s glasses away

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.350
Call her to the top floor and push her down?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.230
I think that&amp;#39;s it.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.340
Who did it?

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.229
Why do this?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.650
I don&amp;#39;t know either

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.810
I can confirm that Sun Ah did not commit suicide

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.079
But she seems to have threatened many people with the fact that she could see the S line

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.670
Many people must have been threatened by her.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.490
So…

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360
Do you think it&amp;#39;s possible to have many pairs of glasses?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.990
Because there have been several cases recently that are similar to the one committed by the guy who lives upstairs from you.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.829
Why am I telling you this now?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.090
Wait a moment

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.200
Isn&amp;#39;t the world you see all red lines?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.980
Um

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.040
Almost all red lines

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.050
Oh... that&amp;#39;s why you wear sunglasses

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.620
You must be living a hard life...

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.800
Sun Ah

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.630
Kang Sun-ah

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.360
What are you doing

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.790
No sleeping in class

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.060
Focus on class

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.050
The human genome can be divided into body chromosomes and sex chromosomes

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.620
There is only one pair of sex chromosomes

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.440
The remaining 22 pairs are autosomes.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.870
Autosomal chromosomes have nothing to do with sex inheritance

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.030
Are you okay?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.750
What&amp;#39;s wrong

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.950
Nothing

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.829
She just woke up screaming in the middle of her sleep in the classroom

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.110
Hello

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.550
You&amp;#39;re just too weak.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.290
Let&amp;#39;s go out and have some fresh air this weekend.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.690
no

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.600
Why not?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.870
If you don&amp;#39;t want to go, just say you don&amp;#39;t want to go.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.430
Because I have something to do

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.520
What&amp;#39;s up

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.780
I&amp;#39;m going to work

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.090
What kind of job do you want to do?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.820
Don&amp;#39;t ask.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.500
Maybe she doesn&amp;#39;t want to say it.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.040
-Meishin Hotel - Meixing Hotel?

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.490
Kim Mei-sung

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.140
I am here

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.080
I asked you to make a new one for me.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.520
You made a mistake again. What do you want?

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.230
You&amp;#39;re really driving me crazy

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.160
Go back and make a new one for me.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.840
sorry

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.500
Those who have never even had sex are still there

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.160
Meixing, where is your hometown?

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.200
Busan

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.170
But you don&amp;#39;t have an accent at all.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.060
I put a lot of effort into correcting my accent.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.500
Is it necessary to do this?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.570
Because I want to be an actor and I&amp;#39;m preparing now

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.080
You want an actor?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.910
yes

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.090
I was also discovered by a scout on the road

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.180
So that&amp;#39;s it

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.580
Do you know if the music teacher has a girlfriend?

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.190
Why are you interested in him?

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.190
He looks so handsome

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.480
-Do you want me to ask him if he has a girlfriend? -Okay.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.690
-Don&amp;#39;t ask? -Just eat your meal.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.140
(Meishin Hotel)

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.310
Hi, I need to take a break.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.289
The total is 30,000 won

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.799
Can&amp;#39;t we stay in a hotel?

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.270
Anyway, we&amp;#39;re only staying for a while and then we&amp;#39;ll leave. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.950
Thanks

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.490
Last time I clearly said I was going to stay in a hotel

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.350
Okay, I&amp;#39;ll take you there next time.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.290
(Kim Hye-young Bang Sung-jin)
Kim Hye-young who bullies Sun-a

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.370
(Jiang Shan&amp;#39;e)
Pushed her down the stairs and ran away

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.000
How could she disappear?

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.210
No card swipe or call records left

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.240
Is it possible that

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.580
After the Chinese teacher pushed Shan&amp;#39;e down the stairs

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.590
Suicide due to excessive self-blame

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.920
This is the most convincing speculation so far.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.770
Because the Chinese teacher&amp;#39;s last received message location was at school

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.010
but

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.950
Until the Chinese teacher&amp;#39;s body is found, he can only be considered missing.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.400
And according to his family

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.910
He has a severe fear of heights.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.930
So he would never push someone off a tall building.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.740
Although we cannot accept this statement completely

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.920
Who is the murderer?

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.770
Zhiyu

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.090
What if Sun-e...

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.950
She won&amp;#39;t commit suicide.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.670
I don&amp;#39;t mean to be opinionated.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.980
But I always feel that something is weird

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.750
(Glasses?)

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.630
Sun Ah becomes a different person after wearing glasses

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.120
What&amp;#39;s the magic of those glasses?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.370
Tell you secretly

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.470
Just put on a pair of glasses

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.800
You can find out who you had sex with.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.970
Really

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.270
Do you think it will be true?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.880
What are you doing?

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.830
Do you want accommodation?

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.780
right

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.630
The total is 60,000 won

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.230
Clang

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.490
How come you guys are here?

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.990
Hello

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.680
Of course I have to visit my friends when they are working.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.800
You are underage and cannot come here.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.170
Hello

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.910
Aren&amp;#39;t you a minor?

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.430
So...

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.780
This is illegal

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.410
So,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.870
Are there any guests now?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.210
Can I go up and take a look?

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:33.890
-Hello-Hello
Hello

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.030
Keep your voice down.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.510
Hello

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.700
It&amp;#39;s so crowded

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.370
It&amp;#39;s so crowded here

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.320
Hello

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.860
So why do you have to run in?

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.330
Very interesting

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.530
I always feel...very exciting

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.110
I need to rest

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.360
Please give me number 206

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.800
Is she coming alone?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.010
(Room 206, Meixing Hotel)

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.060
I think I&amp;#39;ve seen her somewhere.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.270
That&amp;#39;s right

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.470
I&amp;#39;ve had sex with many men.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.190
but

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.470
Since you appeared

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.680
Just having sex with strangers

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.550
It can no longer fill my empty heart.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.410
I am scared

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.510
Afraid that I will always

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.310
Can&amp;#39;t get you

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.990
I really want to make love

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.010
Although not now, but there were many in the past

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.540
That&amp;#39;s not a boyfriend, that&amp;#39;s stalking

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.780
You&amp;#39;ve never been in a relationship, yet you still talk so much

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.430
What&amp;#39;s wrong

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.240
Yeah, that&amp;#39;s right.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.830
What

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.740
The woman who just came here

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.850
We are a staff of the school administration office.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.930
Do you remember

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.120
The one wearing glasses

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.600
Are you sure it&amp;#39;s her?

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.460
They are totally different.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.280
But it can&amp;#39;t escape my sharp eyes

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.920
Can you keep your voice down?

Is there an S line too?

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.589
That&amp;#39;s personal privacy.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.890
So there is

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.820
That Shan&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;s S-line...

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.730
With the classmate named Zhiyuan in your class

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.030
Is it connected?

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.130
no

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.650
I don&amp;#39;t know who it&amp;#39;s connected to.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.430
But

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.970
Not in our class

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.780
I&amp;#39;m going crazy. Damn it.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.520
Who do you think is connected to Sun Ah?

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.750
Is he the one who pushed Sun Ah down?

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.580
right

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.020
It&amp;#39;s possible.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.960
(Random murder occurred in Gangam-dong area)
Random murder occurred again in Gangam-dong area last night

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.610
Although the suspect was arrested immediately not far from the scene

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.990
(The victim was arrested near the scene and died)
Unfortunately, the victim died on the spot

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.670
From the time the suspect was arrested at the scene

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.800
Even if a crime is committed

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.100
(It is expected that the drug poisoning cult will conduct multiple investigations)
Still saying &amp;quot;I am now clean&amp;quot;

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.170
From the continuous laughter

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.030
Mental disorder cannot be ruled out...

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.190
Is it possible to have more than one pair of glasses?

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.330
Glasses…

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.180
Are there several pairs?

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.780
(Music Classroom)

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.230
Excuse me

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.070
The music is so beautiful

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.440
I can’t help but…

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.810
I envy you.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.090
I know so much good music.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.130
What&amp;#39;s the use of that?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.490
I still interact with students every day in school.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.920
Are you a beautiful star?

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.650
- You remember me? - Yes.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.740
What is your dream?

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.460
Guess what

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.210
I don&amp;#39;t think you want to stay in school forever.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.310
Do you want to be an actor?

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.910
Did I guess right?

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.470
How do you know

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.550
I think you are good at expressing things with your body.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.860
You are right

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.380
It&amp;#39;s really magical

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.640
I really have confidence that I can do well.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.830
Those are natural.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.440
Right?

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.590
Are you going home?

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.420
Um

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.620
Where is Kyungjin?

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.910
She said she had something to do at home and left first

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:00.560
that…

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.150
are you free

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.220
I see you like places where there are no people

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.770
How did you know this place?

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.020
I was on the swim team all the way through middle school.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.620
Although I don&amp;#39;t practice swimming

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.790
But sometimes I still sneak out to swim

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.850
Can you swim

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.530
Won&amp;#39;t

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.000
Hey, are you okay?

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.920
What is this?

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.830
(Spicy Cup Noodles)

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.720
It&amp;#39;s all cooked. Eat it quickly.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.510
Delicious

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.190
But can we eat here?

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.560
Well, as long as you don&amp;#39;t get caught.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.310
If Lee Kyung-jin were here

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.460
She will definitely say that she wants to use a gas stove to cook instant noodles.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.290
But just now...

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.740
Why would you jump in?

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.380
If you don&amp;#39;t want to talk, you don&amp;#39;t have to.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.310
Feel sorry

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.280
I…

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.280
From birth

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.630
You can see strange things

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.950
There are red lines on everyone&amp;#39;s head

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.100
Does it look like this?

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.260
Um

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.220
So do I have one too?

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.660
You don&amp;#39;t

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.010
I don&amp;#39;t either

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.530
Neither does Kyung-jin

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.970
Do you believe what I say?

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:28.870
Um

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.070
Why

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.610
Because there&amp;#39;s no reason to lie.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.340
I&amp;#39;m weird, right?

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.390
Um

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.810
Very unusual.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.750
It&amp;#39;s just as I thought.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.300
Very handsome

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.180
I&amp;#39;m too ordinary.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.710
Even if I disappear tomorrow, I don&amp;#39;t think anyone will notice

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.290
If you disappear

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.420
At least Jingzhen and I will know.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.320
That is true.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.340
How many times do you want me to say

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.590
- Just say it&amp;#39;s not me. - Yes

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.720
Do I look like a fraud?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.490
Ms. Kang So-min

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.930
Oh my god

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.050
Zhiyu, long time no see.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.950
Long time no see

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.680
Why don&amp;#39;t you answer my call? I miss you so much

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:02.770
Well...

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.010
No matter how much of a criminal I am, I still can&amp;#39;t...

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.390
Wasn&amp;#39;t it the first time?

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.710
He was just a suspect then.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.930
Are you the kind of person who picks on people?

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.720
It&amp;#39;s over, right?

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.130
Can I go now?

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.100
good

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.870
Remember to answer my call

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.360
Bro, when exactly did you...

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.990
You don&amp;#39;t have to know

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.280
(Lee Ji Won)

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:48.170
(Kang Sun-ah&amp;#39;s boyfriend?)

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.630
elder brother

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.530
But you don&amp;#39;t date girls?

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.610
Am I dating anyone?

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.580
No, although we are not dating

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.290
But aren&amp;#39;t you always busy?

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.150
That&amp;#39;s right.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.100
Is it the window period now?

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.250
I&amp;#39;m curious about someone

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.750
But I don&amp;#39;t want to sleep with her

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.600
Why dumbfounded

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.140
What Why

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.830
Can&amp;#39;t I have someone I&amp;#39;m simply curious about?

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.560
I need to rest

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.300
Please give me room 206

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.860
That&amp;#39;s right

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.330
I have had sex with many men.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:33.630
That&amp;#39;s right

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.050
I have had sex with many men.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.690
That&amp;#39;s right

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.490
I have had sex with many men.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.290
That&amp;#39;s right

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.050
I&amp;#39;ve been with a lot of men

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.950
There are relationships

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.900
In the Beginning

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.430
Even if there is only one room where I can lie down

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.770
I am very satisfied

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.670
I even think that maybe tomorrow I will become a famous actor

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.330
But then…

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.370
My ears started to hurt.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.190
I don&amp;#39;t mind the noises from other people next door.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.390
The problem is my voice

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.920
Afraid of my actions

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.110
Make a sound with me

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.010
Will be heard by others

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.020
The same is true at school

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.520
I&amp;#39;m afraid someone will hear

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.970
The laughter I made when I looked at the teacher

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.670
Then I found this place

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.560
An old hotel that looks deserted in broad daylight

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.350
In this room I am free

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.710
Then one day I found a pair of glasses

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.700
I am perfect when I see through the glasses

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.140
Then at a certain moment

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.150
I became a spectator

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.530
This room is perfect

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.010
It&amp;#39;s my perfect world

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.530
Come on

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.130
But why did you suddenly come to the motel?

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.860
I just remembered the past.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.850
It&amp;#39;s quite fresh

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.659
Don&amp;#39;t you miss me?

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.610
I&amp;#39;ll see you when I turn on the TV. There&amp;#39;s no need.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.489
Really

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.560
Are you leaving?

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.560
How about the same time tomorrow?

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.440
(Yin Junshan: Are you still at the Meixing Hotel today?) (Yes, I am at work.)

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.920
(Yin Junshan: Can I come over?)

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.400
I want to extend my stay

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.320
Room number

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.570
Room 206

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.530
How is it suitable for me?

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.690
- You&amp;#39;re here. - Yes.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.820
Teacher, you came early.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.960
Meixing?

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.080
teacher

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.330
This song

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.740
It&amp;#39;s the song we listened to together back then.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.020
How did you get here?

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.320
Teacher, I

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.860
I have something to confess to you.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.710
What

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.770
Teacher, I

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.900
I have been with many men

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.450
Had a relationship

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.090
What are you talking about?

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.120
That&amp;#39;s right

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.810
I&amp;#39;ve had sex with a lot of men.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.090
but

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.400
Since you appeared

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.480
Just having sex with a strange man

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.860
Can&amp;#39;t fill the emptiness in my heart

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.840
I am scared

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.270
I’m afraid I’ll never...

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.740
Can&amp;#39;t have you

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.780
Are you crazy?

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.710
A crazy woman indeed.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.850
That&amp;#39;s right

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:43.410
I&amp;#39;ve had sex with a lot of men.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.780
Are you throwing it at me now?

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.150
right

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.210
Oh wait…

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.950
What&amp;#39;s wrong with me?

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.110
It feels so strange

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.560
I put drugs in the water in advance

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.540
You&amp;#39;ll be fine soon.

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:40.610
That&amp;#39;s right

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.300
I&amp;#39;ve been with a lot of men

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.950
Had a relationship

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.870
But since you showed up

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.170
Just having sex with a strange man

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:00.730
Can&amp;#39;t fill the emptiness in my heart

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.230
No, teacher

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:33.810
teacher

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.200
Please

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.810
That’s right…

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:35.210
I have had sex with many men...

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.610
Are you okay?

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.150
Depend on

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.000
A crazy woman hit me.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.680
And took my clothes away

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.740
Fuck this crazy woman

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.320
Where did you run to?

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.750
it hurts

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.070
Please help me call the police

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.810
There&amp;#39;s nothing like glasses at the scene.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:15.160
No

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.810
Have you seen those people&amp;#39;s S lines?

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.420
The employee sister originally only had one line

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.770
I don&amp;#39;t feel connected to my music teacher.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.390
Why do you do this?

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.470
have no idea…

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.520
Probably you will never know.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:08.030
Do you think this incident is also related to glasses?

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:15.140
No matter how you think about it, she always wears glasses in school

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.300
Looks like the glasses we&amp;#39;re looking for.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.290
When she came to Meixing Hotel

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:24.630
It looks completely different from when I was in school.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.390
After she put on the glasses

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.190
You should feel special.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.010
Mr. Detective

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.990
No one is exempt

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.470
That&amp;#39;s why I say those glasses are dangerous.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.800
Mr. Detective

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.650
No one is exempt

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.880
That&amp;#39;s why I say those glasses are dangerous.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.910

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:54.910
(Center)

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:59.040
(And Lee Da Hee)

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.320
I was going to say this first.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.300
Please give me

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.660
The moment I put on these glasses

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.570
Wow...it turns out what you said is true

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:18.070
So I got goosebumps all over my body

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:19.800
I don&amp;#39;t believe you

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.340
Throw away those glasses immediately.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.480
It seems that a sexual assault of a minor has occurred.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.700
Do you have sexual experience?

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.070
No

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.600
Why did she lie?

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.420
There seems to be a lot of things happening in school recently.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:35.960
Mr. Detective

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:37.610
Is she single from birth?

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:39.250
You wear glasses.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:42.000
Excuse me...are you free to have dinner with me soon?

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.910
What

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:02.430

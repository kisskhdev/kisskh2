00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.266
previously

00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.100
on seducing

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.133
jake palma

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.200
excuse me

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.366
you're my girlfriend

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.166
act

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.266
like

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.700
one

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.133
Stop it, Alice.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.766
You don't love him, do you?

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:31.966
Okay, baby.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.133
oh

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.766
why

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.333
you are terrible

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.866
go ahead

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.666
I will teach you.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.366
okay, that's good

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.100
but can you really do this alone?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
but what

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.366
kiss me

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.133
oh my

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.366
Why is he so handsome?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.566
This is the wild again.

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:49.566
palpitation

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.500
of my heart

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.300
oh my gosh

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.166
This is happening more often.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.100
feeling

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.333
Why am I attracted to him?

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:04.466
yes

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.000
shems

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.066
Drake will be my first kiss.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:10.566
cannot be

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:11.966
I don't want to

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:39.066
Did he really kiss my neck?

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.766
the sweet one like cola cola

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.700
oh you

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:00.866
always looking for

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.600
Eugene Kalma

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:44.866
Why don't I want to go to the bathroom in my room?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.733
Why don't I want to take a bath?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.900
why not

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.500
I want to wipe my neck.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.966
huh

00:03:58.966 --> 00:03:59.766
oh no

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:07.866
oh

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:11.366
very very uncomfortable in answering

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.933
Is it obvious that I'm not there?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.900
in the mood

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.733
Let's talk now, Alice.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:18.466
luh

00:04:21.066 --> 00:04:21.533
problem

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:22.966
So why me?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.566
The resentment is coming out.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.766
baka kent problems

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.700
again

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.000
his/her

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:30.533
shipper

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:30.900
the cute

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.733
They really don't

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.900
they're so cute and fluffy

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:38.666
alice

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:39.666
mom

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.700
shin is here

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.900
he's in the garden

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.200
Just go there.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.400
okay mom

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:48.666
Why are you here?

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:49.333

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:50.133
my loves

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:57.166
cute pajamas

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.400
check

00:04:58.766 --> 00:04:59.600
cute slippers

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.900
check

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.100
lip balm

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:26.500
i miss you too

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:28.666
What are you doing?

00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:29.666
you here

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:33.200
I just wanted to ask you something.

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:38.933
yes, yes

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:40.266
ha

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.533
Aren't you going to ask me if you can?

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:44.466
to be a girlfriend

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.300
yes, yes

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:53.133
no

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:54.066
What are you?

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:55.566
You are really crazy.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:59.100
I was just going to ask.

00:06:00.466 --> 00:06:01.900
Do you love Drake?

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:06.600
what is it?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.066
What kind of question is that?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.700
nothing at all

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:15.100
of course

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.900
as your bestfriend

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:17.400
I just want to know if

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:20.133
What exactly are you and Drake like?

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.766
Because you became what you are because of my request, right?

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.733
I'm just curious if you really love him.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.066
why do you want to know

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:32.666
if you don't love him/her

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.133
I will find a way to separate you.

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:35.866
I don't want to

00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.366
You end up like Drake.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.400
it just is

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.133
so what now

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.400
What exactly is Drake to you?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.133
Why did he ask me this?

00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:49.300
Is he just making sure that there is no hope left?

00:06:49.366 --> 00:06:50.333
Hey Drake!

00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:52.533
because we really are

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:54.166
boyfriend

00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:54.966
I am.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.466
How are you?

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:59.366
We're almost months old, right?

00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:01.200
go ahead

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.100
Alice Perez

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:03.533
Just fool me.

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:04.900
shin and yourself

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:07.866
Well, don't you have any feelings for Drake?

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.666
Well, it looks like your palpitations are getting more frequent.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:14.466
hmmm

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:15.733
really

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.766
yes best friend

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.300
I don't even know what.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.900
I will give him a gift on his birthday.

00:07:23.133 --> 00:07:23.766
us, huh?

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:24.933
Maybe you have an idea.

00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:26.066
best friend

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:30.766
maybe it's free

00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:32.500
in the name

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.300
I guess he likes something else.

00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:39.900
If only it were just us

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:42.333
Well, I'm not giving him a gift.

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:44.700
but this is your last time, alice

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.900
after this

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.733
I'm moving on, loves.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:50.166
and why should I move on?

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.100
It wasn't us, was it?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.800

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.966

00:07:58.166 --> 00:07:58.966

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.100
I don't need it anymore.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.800
already being taught

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.466
I and Drake read analog

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:26.966

00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:28.466

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.166
letting you go now

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.500
I won't call you love anymore.

00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:44.533
maybe more

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:45.200
friends

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.133
We are really alone.

00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:50.500
I will also find someone to love someday.

00:08:50.966 --> 00:08:53.600
but you won't find someone to love you

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:55.166

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:00.566

00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:26.866
You were so grumpy last night.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.966
You couldn't talk properly and now you're being surprised.

00:09:29.066 --> 00:09:29.866
You surprised me.

00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:32.000
Let's go, bess.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.000
Let's not deny it.

00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:34.900
in the morning

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.566
We should always avoid negativity.

00:09:37.566 --> 00:09:38.366
this is it

00:09:39.066 --> 00:09:40.266

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.666

I can scream like a fan girl.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.866

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.900

katrina

00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:40.666
Why?

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:42.733
I miss Uncle Steve already.

00:13:46.266 --> 00:13:47.166

00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:49.466
You have a crush on Uncle Steve, right?

00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:09.266

My mother voted for him.

00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:14.466
Well, it's just not enough to force it.

00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:15.900
Kent, marry me.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.800
Is that right?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.300

Well, if I hit you, right?

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.266
It's true that you will get lost.

00:14:31.366 --> 00:14:32.200
You're on my biceps, right?

00:14:44.866 --> 00:14:45.700
Let's eat first.

You can have breakfast with Uncle Steve there.

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:54.200

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.500
nailed

00:20:14.533 --> 00:20:15.333

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.000
How is that?

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.133
necessary

but he is wet

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.466
It's a shame if

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.000
You should change because your room is upstairs.

00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:29.266
It would also be a shame if we had to wait for this.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.900
designer

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.700

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
the good thing to do

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.466
there to undress

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:34.366

00:21:10.266 --> 00:21:11.400
Did you say that?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.766
so that

00:21:12.766 --> 00:21:14.266
who is behind this again?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.266
what kind?

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.466

00:21:53.266 --> 00:21:54.800
You think I know your techniques?

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.966

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:56.866
Okay, take a look.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.600
Okay, take a look.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.400

All assembled.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.800
Do you know your partners yet?

00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:25.566
What are you waiting for?

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:25.966

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.133

I didn't see you.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.300
starting Monday, huh?

00:27:51.766 --> 00:27:52.566
oh yeah

00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:53.700
yes, that's right

00:27:54.766 --> 00:27:55.566
because I'm busy

00:27:57.166 --> 00:27:58.600
You just got a boyfriend.

00:27:58.733 --> 00:27:59.533
busy na

00:28:00.733 --> 00:28:01.533
What is it really?

00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:02.200
want to say

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.100
ni to shin

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.266
but that doesn't matter anymore

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:07.800
I said I'm moving on from him.

00:28:08.566 --> 00:28:09.366
not possible

00:28:11.366 --> 00:28:12.166
their

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.166
because you're about to have a monthly period

00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:15.133
ni drake

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:15.766
forget

00:28:15.766 --> 00:28:17.166
you have a best friend

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.700
ha monthsary ha

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.300
monthly

00:28:23.066 --> 00:28:25.166
Yes, didn't you say you have a monthly salary?

00:28:26.533 --> 00:28:27.333
ah

00:28:27.666 --> 00:28:30.600
Yes, we have a monthsary on November thirty-one.

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:34.533
Okay, I'm in.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.600
tay shin

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.566
Why did you even remind me?

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.566
Shin is the month of the month

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.500
We are weird.

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:56.333
That's Drake.

00:28:57.066 --> 00:28:58.200
I didn't tell him.

00:28:58.466 --> 00:28:59.266
exact date

00:29:02.933 --> 00:29:04.600
shin is really annoying

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:06.066
You know what it's like to be forced.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.733
you forget that date and

00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:09.000
he will just remind

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.933
That's why thirty-one is only seven times a year.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.966
and then he reminded me

00:29:16.933 --> 00:29:19.266
How do I remember this from Drake Palma?

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.066
what is it

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:23.500

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.300
I will tomorrow

00:29:31.566 --> 00:29:32.366

00:29:33.366 --> 00:29:34.400
sleep all night

00:29:34.566 --> 00:29:35.733
all day tomorrow

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.200
pretend to be sick

00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:41.766
Oh, I can't lie to mommy.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.200
alis alis

00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:47.466

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.300
I forgot

00:29:55.466 --> 00:29:57.400
My memory is weak, so

00:29:57.966 --> 00:29:58.766
okay

00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:04.566
ha or si

00:30:07.666 --> 00:30:10.533
Let me just wish Drake a happy monthsary.

00:30:16.566 --> 00:30:19.500
Why am I thinking about Drake instead of studying?

00:30:19.666 --> 00:30:20.466
annoying

00:30:20.766 --> 00:30:22.800
What is that? It's leaving.

00:30:31.733 --> 00:30:32.533
so your things

00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:33.466

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.200

00:30:38.566 --> 00:30:39.366

00:30:39.366 --> 00:30:41.533

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.266
tonight

00:30:42.266 --> 00:30:43.133
I don't want to, ma'am.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.700
why

00:30:45.266 --> 00:30:46.066
I don't like that.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.133
I know how to

00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:49.000
That's it, your dad and I are leaving.

00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:50.766
you have no one to go with

00:30:51.466 --> 00:30:52.600
Where are you going?

00:30:55.733 --> 00:30:56.533
ah

00:30:56.766 --> 00:30:57.566
secret

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.100
yuck

00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:05.166
that one

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.500
You are so naughty.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.400
You are a playboy.

00:31:09.466 --> 00:31:11.600
Not because I took care of you that day.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.000
I'm your girlfriend.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.500
You scared me too.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.100
Why don't you just date the person who has a crush on you?

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.000
eh

00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:24.333
that one

00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:26.966
Don't say I love you.

00:31:28.933 --> 00:31:30.266
not the one I love you

00:31:30.866 --> 00:31:31.900
you're really disgusting

00:31:32.066 --> 00:31:32.866
sibilant

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.166
What's wrong with you, talking?

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.100
this is awesome today

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:39.733
Well, you're there.

00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:41.366
no

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.133
I'm just a three-dimensional image.

00:31:43.366 --> 00:31:44.933
I didn't hear the eeq either.

00:31:45.066 --> 00:31:45.866
2019

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.600
Oh, what is this?

00:31:48.166 --> 00:31:49.066

00:31:59.366 --> 00:32:00.400
Are you sick?

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.933
Oh, why are you studying?

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.366
You have a fever.

00:32:05.466 --> 00:32:07.200
I'm changing my life.

00:32:08.366 --> 00:32:09.566
I have a new life.

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:11.933
but

00:32:11.966 --> 00:32:13.000
Why did you say that?

00:32:13.133 --> 00:32:14.700
I'm sleeping here because of mommy.

00:32:15.766 --> 00:32:17.166
Do you have any plans?

00:32:19.766 --> 00:32:20.866
You are so awesome, bro.

00:32:20.933 --> 00:32:22.200
You are too judgmental.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.466
Well, how could I not doubt you when I dropped you?

00:32:25.533 --> 00:32:26.333
let's practice

00:32:28.533 --> 00:32:29.333
bes

00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:30.533
I'm sorry.

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:33.133

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.200
let's go

00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:36.933
Hey, mommy is leaving because she's going to

00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:37.700
ridge

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.366
Only the two of us will be left here, so

00:32:39.966 --> 00:32:40.733

00:32:40.733 --> 00:32:41.533

Oh, you agreed.

00:32:45.566 --> 00:32:46.600
You agree, okay?

00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:48.366
I'm just getting ready.

00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:49.800
He/She has agreed.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.733
Maybe it's okay to be a little bit naughty.

00:32:53.866 --> 00:32:55.100
just to forget about

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.900
monthly

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.733
Drake and I

00:33:03.966 --> 00:33:04.766
What is it?

00:33:04.766 --> 00:33:05.733
You can buy it here.

00:33:09.466 --> 00:33:10.266
that's what they say

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.100
I'm fine.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.900
I don't know, I'm leaving.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.100
You're still good at lying.

00:33:16.166 --> 00:33:17.400
Well, you're really annoying, uncle.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.400

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.500

00:33:23.533 --> 00:33:24.900
oh we're just going to look at something there

00:33:25.066 --> 00:33:26.066
I'll just go with you.

00:33:26.533 --> 00:33:27.466
We will leave you alone.

00:33:27.533 --> 00:33:28.333

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.966

00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:03.566
Where are we going?

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:30.133
I am tired.

00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:32.000
We've been wandering around for a while now.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.500

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.701
CHILD ACTORS WERE

BLUE DRAGON FILM AWARD
FOR BEST ACTRESS

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.457
LOVE IN WHITE, LEE DAEUM

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:44.461
Ah.

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:48.924
- Were you hungry?
- Yeah.

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.843
- Here.
- Looks so good!

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:01.270
Mmm.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.191
Give me some of that.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.031
Mr. Lee.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.909
How about a grand high five?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:17.869
Shall we?

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.038
Yay!

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.501
What should we do now?

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.336
Mmm.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.715
Oh, did you read the script
I gave you last time?

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.842
You haven't said anything.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.262
Forget the movie.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.388
Let's go on a date.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:40.058
Whoa. Congratulations, Daeum.

00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:41.476
Wow, Best Actress.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.395
- It's my first time actually seeing this.
- Right?

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.481
Since you've only ever won Best Director.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:48.650
- Let me see it a bit more.
- No! I won't let you!

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.111
- Just let me look.
- No! You can't!

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:07.961
<i>Congratulations.</i>

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.757
<i>Thank you, Mr. Lee.</i>

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.009
<i>Thank you too.</i>

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:30.025
EPISODE 11

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.818
<i>I really want to live.</i>

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.211
I want to live so badly.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.015
I'm sorry.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.519
I know you'd get upset when I do this.

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:08.063
I'm really sorry.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.191
Why are you sorry?

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.404
Because I might be upset?

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.492
Being scared, hurting, and wanting to live

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.704
aren't things to apologize for.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.296
Don't be sorry.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.883
Not to me or anyone else, okay?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.052
If anything, I'm sorry.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:45.016
Because all I can do for you
is just keep this one movie going.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.229
It's not "just" one movie.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.065
I'm making this movie

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.110
with you and everyone in there.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.446
You made that possible.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.782
I'm crying because I love that.

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.742
Because I'm so happy.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.830
Because I feel so alive.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.428
We came here without telling you
to surprise you.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.263
Was it too much?

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.931
No.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.184
I loved it.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.395
I cried because I was so happy.

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:34.941
Thank you all
for coming together again like this.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:36.818
Come on.

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:39.362
We're a team. Of course we showed up.

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.907
So are we starting the shoot again?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.327
There are still a few more people
we're waiting on.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.456
Seoyoung and Jungwoo's agencies said
they can't clear their schedules.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.418
I heard talks
of Director Park gathering his crew.

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.170
What's Mr. Bu doing?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.925
He's not reading our group chat
or picking up his phone.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.808
When I watch a movie,

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.393
I only care about who's in it.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.729
Who cares about the director?

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.523
Yes, that's what the audience sees.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.651
But the process matters too.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:19.736
Oh, is that so?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:25.742
Then why don't you get
your precious process sorted already?

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:30.247
I'm also worried like hell
that Lee Daeum might die.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:42.050
I'm guessing you're not here
because you missed me.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.718
Is this about the film?

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.179
Let's finish this movie together.

00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:49.808
I feel sorry for Daeum,
but this is important to me too.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.309
If I keep emotions out of it…

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.061
But you never do that.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.230
You can't even do that now.

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:58.441
You know it won't be finished

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.777
if we pull out of it too.

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.697
And it's not just
about Lee Daeum or Lee Jeha.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.157
I'm speaking to you as a fellow actor.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.910
You know too that I was out of my depth.

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.203
You weren't.

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:14.374
I saw how focused and keen you were,
more than you were for any other movie.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.209
You've got what it takes.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.128
And you want it too.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:20.881
You have to play Hyunsang.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.800
You're finally seeing me.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.179
- Jungwoo.
- I know you don't eat carbs.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.682
Hold on. I'll make you a salad.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.231
RAMYEON

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.191
You kept saying

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.445
you wanted to eat cup noodles with me
over a dozen times.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.907
But I never did, not even once.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.826
It's getting soggy. Let's just eat.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.121
I'm sorry.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.373
Don't be sorry.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.710
I'm sorry for treating you so poorly

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.047
when you're always so kind.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:06.968
I'm sorry for saying this so late.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.577
Oh.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.373
Ms. Chae.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.792
Jungwoo's here too.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.544
Thanks for coming.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.130
How's your condition, Daeum?

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.841
To be honest, I'm not great.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.053
I could go into seizure out of nowhere,

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.514
and if it leads to shock, I could die.

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:54.349
But…

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.268
I've lived like this since I was 20.

00:07:57.352 --> 00:08:00.980
I promise I won't die
until we finish this movie.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.233
So don't worry.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.654
We're going to need a lot of help
when we start shooting again.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.281
But we will never

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.243
let the worst happen.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.163
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>Gyuwon's story is too tragic?</i>

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:19.332
She's young and beautiful

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.545
but has to die
after losing the man she loves.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:27.966
I don't think it's such a tragedy if
you live the life you have meaningfully.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:30.427
Daeum.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.013
Let's trust Mr. Lee

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.515
and give this a shot.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.475
And I'll do my best

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.018
to love Gyuwon.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:43.815
And I'll keep loving Hyunsang
until the end.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.359
Strange conversation.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:49.988
Thank you. Both of you.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.072
Thank you so much.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.200
Also, there's something

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:57.704
I have to tell you two.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.791
The article about the director change
goes out today, right?

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.002
What time?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.254
Let's see it together.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.385
Come in.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.098
Dr. Lee.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.187
Huh. You were watching?

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.357
Like father, like daughter.
She looks great on screen, doesn't she?

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:28.026
Let me take a look.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.696
She doesn't look like you at all.

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.868
Yes, we cast a real terminal patient
for a terminally ill character.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:38.369
At first,

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.914
we met for a medical consultation.

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.709
I showed up
to the audition uninvited.

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.378
Mr. Lee said it was dangerous,

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.757
but I told him no one could
play this role better than me.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.469
I asked him to see me as an actress,
not as a sick person.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.180
<i>I was very honest with him</i>

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.390
<i>and said I wanted to do it</i>
<i>even if it killed me.</i>

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.228
<i>She said she can</i>
<i>still watch movies, go to auditions,</i>

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.230
fall in love,

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:07.941
and even make movies too.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.984
<i>When I heard that,</i>

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.736
<i>I wanted to give her a chance.</i>

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:16.241
I heard there's another reason
why it had to be Ms. Lee

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.951
you had to make this film with.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.035
Yes.

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.663
<i>It's true that we're seeing each other,</i>

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.206
<i>that Daeum is sick,</i>

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.251
and that I knew about her illness
when I cast her.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.961
<i>However,</i>

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:31.297
<i>that's not the only reason</i>
<i>why I'm speaking to you today.</i>

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.091
<i>There's…</i>

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:37.011
something else I need to be honest about.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:49.732
It's about…

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.694
my father, director Lee Duyoung.

00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.660
My father created his films
using stolen scripts

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:02.912
<i>and made a name for himself.</i>

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:08.334
<i>His Cannes-winning film,</i> Love in White,
<i>and all his most famous works,</i>

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.336
<i>were not actually written by him.</i>

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.589
<i>Those scripts were all written</i>

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.174
by his wife…

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.178
and my mother, Yu Eunae.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.347
<i>Lee Duyoung erased her name</i>
<i>from all credits</i>

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.975
<i>for the sake of protecting</i>
<i>his own reputation</i>

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.643
<i>and continued to make films.</i>

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.437
LEE JEHA EXPOSES
LEGENDARY FATHER'S PLAGIARISM

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.273
How insane do they have to be?

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:34.485
So your father stole your mother's work.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.489
Why reveal both your family history
and the plagiarism now?

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.868
When I finally decided to direct
<i>Love in White</i>

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.037
after wandering aimlessly for five years,

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:48.208
I, too, tried to use someone's dream…

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.460
No,

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.421
I mean,

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.548
Daeum's dream

00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:58.551
for my own ends.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.096
<i>But I realized something</i>
<i>while making this film.</i>

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.098
<i>That no one has the right</i>

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.684
<i>to use someone else's dream.</i>

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.355
<i>That it's wrong</i>
<i>to steal and exploit a dream</i>

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.192
that means more
than life itself to another.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.697
I want to finish this film with Daeum,

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.408
who pours her whole heart into every scene

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.285
to capture the beauty of life.

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:29.999
Test shoot, take one.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.294
Ready.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.339
Action!

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:42.053
<i>Making a movie…</i>

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.430
it's a killer job.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.015
I'll see you later!

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.352
<i>And…</i>

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.773
<i>Yu Eunae,</i>
<i>my mother and the original writer,</i>

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.901
<i>never lost hope and kept writing</i>

00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.821
<i>even at the end of her life.</i>

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.741
<i>I wanted to tell the story</i>

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.413
that she truly wanted
to share with the world

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.375
through <i>Love in White</i>.

00:13:14.085 --> 00:13:17.297
So it's true that Mr. Bu
wanted to make it up to me

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.382
for freezing me out all this time.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.926
I know you've taken a big interest in me.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.637
You've written plenty
linking me and my father.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.055
Exactly.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.182
So why'd you give me the interview?

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.935
I wanted as many people
to see it as possible.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.354
You always get the most views.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.775
Ah. Sure.

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.029
I'll make sure Kim Jinyeo's interview
is a good one too.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.864
Yes, thank you.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:46.826
Just make sure this movie gets finished.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.412
That way, I'll have more to write about.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.623
And next time,
I'll go with even juicier headlines.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.797
<i>What the hell is this movie?</i>

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.842
Why is he out there
airing out his family's dirty laundry?

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.511
Does he think it's his movie?
It's not even his money!

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:06.804
And you think it's yours?

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:09.807
What did you say to me?

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.895
If you want to throw money at films,

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:15.938
at least make the effort

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:19.067
to watch some and learn how they're made,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.319
you joke of an executive.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:23.154
- Hey.
- "Hey"?

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:24.989
What's with the attitude?

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.117
You're an executive at Youngjin,
not my company.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.703
I'm the CEO of my company,
you little shit!

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.040
You're just a kid with cash
trying to jerk around people

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.375
who put their lives on the line
for this work.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.211
And what? "Amusing"?

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:40.463
Yeah, it's amusing to me too.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.965
Saying whatever the hell I want
is so amusing!

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.258
Pull your money.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.761
Every last penny, okay?

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.472
I'll sell my office building,
take out loans,

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:53.851
or maybe even go around
and grovel a bit more if I have to.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:55.520
I don't need your money.

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.159
<i>Let me make a proposal to you.</i>

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:12.245
Let's hear what that proposal is first.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.206
You know what people say
about me in this business.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:17.834
The guy who makes movies
off his daddy's name?

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.585
And what about you?

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:22.255
A money-grubber
who only sees movies as cash cows?

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.173
But now,

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.175
an opportunist
trying to fix that reputation

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.428
by latching on to
the legendary director's son, Lee Jeha.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.556
You know it well.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.558
Dude, you think that's funny?

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.018
How about we become
a director and producer

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:41.274
who stick by this film until the end
without caring about money or fame?

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:44.902
Man, that kind of romantic life
wasn't meant for me.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.780
Still, I'd love to try it once
before I die.

00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:50.992
Then let's stop wishing
and actually do it.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.161
Seungwon.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.829
I'm going to expose what my father did.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:58.374
Whether I disappear from the industry
or get canceled,

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.209
I'll deal with that myself.

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.254
You just use me

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:06.007
to be the good producer
who's only looking out for the movie.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.553
Are you sure
you can win over the cast and crew?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:12.972
If that's the case,

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.184
I'll take care
of selling this movie to the world.

00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:19.061
Canceled from the industry?

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.940
Come on, man. I'm Bu Seungwon.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:27.153
Why would you get canceled
when I'm with you?

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:29.488
Make this movie a hit.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:30.573
That's my condition.

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.125
Hey…

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.969
Ah, you consistent bastard.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.197
How much did I pay for Jeha's soju?

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.007
I can finally breathe a little now.

00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.265
What is it?

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.433
Should I comfort you,

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.686
or congratulate you?

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:44.105
I don't think it's either.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:20.308
LOVE IN WHITE

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:21.976
- Seungwon.
- Hey, is it over?

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.729
Well done, both of you.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.564
You feel relieved now?

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:28.733
Thanks, Seungwon.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.280
Thank you.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:37.158
No, I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.994
I just lost myself chasing money.

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:42.330
But all that aside,

00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:44.165
I'm sorry for what I did, Daeum.

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:48.502
You really are a good person, Mr. Bu.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.088
You're amazing.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:52.465
Hey now, come on.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:55.301
This movie just won't let me be.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.887
Don't try to carry it all on your own.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.722
It doesn't suit you and it's not cool.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.558
Of course not.
We're splitting this burden evenly.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:03.643
Brace yourself.

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:06.103
We're starting a funding campaign
right away.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:09.148
I want to help too, sir.

00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:19.158
Hmm. A lot of hateful comments.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.411
Ugh.
I really hope Daeum doesn't see these.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.039
I'm worried about Mr. Lee too.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:29.001
It must've been very tough
to reveal that kind of family history.

00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:32.046
I can really see
where that kind of courage came from.

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:33.506
Where did it come from?

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.092
Where else but love?

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.095
You said that kind of love doesn't exist.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.722
I guess I haven't lived long enough.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:42.973
But I see it right here.

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:45.685
Love…

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:50.606

Before I begin,

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.967
there's something
I want to ask all of you.

00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:43.552
Enjoy, everyone!

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:45.346

- Yeah?

Have some of this.

Minjeong's mother told us

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.697

I heard you sold your company building.

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.540
So it's true.

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:55.875
Yes, well…

00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:58.836
You're selling your building,

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.713
but not paying your actors?

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.883
Come on, we've known each other for ages.

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:06.343
Don't make it all about business.

00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:07.803
All about business?

00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:10.764
Well, it was never personal.
Let's just talk money.

00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.479
Thank you, come again.

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:18.814
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:20.190
Thank you, come again.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:22.568
Excuse me.

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:25.738
You're actress Lee Daeum, aren't you?

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.489
Uh.

00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:28.574
Yes.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:31.076
I saw the article. I donated too.

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:32.912
Thank you.

00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.580
I'm actually sick too.

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:37.666
I'm about to start chemo now.

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:41.921
But I'll make sure
to see <i>Love in White</i> in the theater.

00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:43.547
Uh…

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:52.765
Sorry, but…

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:56.477
would it be okay if I gave you a hug?

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:07.655
Good luck with chemo.

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:09.573
Thank you.

00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:13.786
Thank you.

00:24:20.376 --> 00:24:23.379
You want to switch
to back-end pay? But why?

00:24:24.088 --> 00:24:26.507
Uh… Thank you, obviously. But why?

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:30.010
Even with the funding,
it won't be enough, right?

00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.721
Can you afford to pay me
and Jungwoo our full rates?

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:34.181
No.

00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:35.933
Thought so.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.310
I already talked it over with Jungwoo.

00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:41.313
Thank you so much.
You're making me tear up.

00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:44.274
I was already so thankful
for Ms. Go's investment.

00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:49.863
I didn't expect that from her,
but she turned out to be pretty loyal.

00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:53.701
You didn't know at all?

00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:04.086
What's this? You didn't even call.

00:25:07.006 --> 00:25:08.173
Aren't you cold?

00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:16.098
<i>Seriously.</i>

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.267
I even asked her why,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.645
and she said,
"If Seoyoung's in, what choice do I have?"

00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:25.024
"She's the kind of actress
who never backs down once she commits."

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.902
What were you thinking,
investing in <i>Love in White</i>?

00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:31.697
I ran out of things to spend money on.

00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:34.033
You said anyone but Lee Jeha.

00:25:35.242 --> 00:25:37.411
That everyone's crazy
and I should pull out.

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.039
Well…

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:42.416
I guess I'm crazy too.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.629
After all that talk.

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:55.554
When you go down,
it feels like I'm going down.

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:57.806
I failed to become an actress,

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:01.560
so I'm living out that dream
vicariously through you.

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.228
So you…

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:05.606
can't go down.

00:26:13.614 --> 00:26:14.865
Hyeyoung.

00:26:14.948 --> 00:26:16.116
Yeah?

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:19.286
I don't know why I act so mean

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.832
to the people who only care about me.

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.129
If you know that, then act your heart out
and make <i>Love in White</i> a hit.

00:26:30.047 --> 00:26:31.507
Chae Seoyoung's success

00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:33.884
is Go Hyeyoung's success too.

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:11.463
I must've dozed off
while I was watching you.

00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:14.091
It's still really early.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.926
Lie down a bit more.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.360
Miracle…

00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:35.821
or hope…

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.657
I used to hate words like that,

00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:42.953
because they were never meant for me.

00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:45.289
But now…

00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:49.626
my whole world feels like a miracle.

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.838
My whole world changed too.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.716
It used to be so dark…

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.639
but you keep filling it with light.

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.864
Gosh.

00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:21.950
Why did you shut down the studio's office?

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.411
I sold it.

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:28.248
It's prime real estate in Hannam-dong,
so it got sold in a snap.

00:28:28.332 --> 00:28:31.793
The building was 10 billion won,
but I had a 7 billion loan on it.

00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:35.130
I didn't walk away with much after taxes.

00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:37.758
Forget that. Look at this.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.973
LOVE IN WHITE
501,850,000 WON

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:47.935
All the people
you and Daeum brought together

00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:49.436
are basically our audience.

00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:52.940
Wow, I didn't think
it could work like this.

00:29:04.534 --> 00:29:06.119
Wow. Andong.

00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:07.245
The land of scholars.

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:10.958
How about braised chicken
for lunch?

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.919
Braised chicken,
raw chicken, I don't care.

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:15.837
Our production's dead broke.

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:18.298
Now that Mr. Han's out,
we can't even afford to breathe.

00:29:19.216 --> 00:29:22.386
Even with Beyond's investment
and the 500 million won crowdfunding?

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:24.680
Still doesn't cover
half the original budget.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:27.516
Trying to finish the shoot
on scraps like this

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:31.103
is literally suffocating me.

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:33.188
Let's go.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:38.068
Let's go to Andong.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.238
We can change the tone a bit.

00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:44.783
Scene 87, when Hyunsang changes his mind.

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:46.702
We should film that scene there.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.204
Can you pass me the location deck?

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.957
- Here.
- What? You totally ignored that last time.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.917
That was then, this is now.

00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:55.377
WOLYEONG-GYO BRIDGE

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.838
Look, just say it straight. I can take it.

00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.297
Please. You're scaring me.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.341
Honestly?

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.053
I like it.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:07.305
Wolyeong-gyo Bridge.

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.224
Yeah, this place is pretty.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.810
Perfect spot to restart the shoot.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.938
Hold on, I'm about to tear up.

00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:16.398
Let's order some braised chicken.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.774
Of course.

00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:20.402
I'm booking the schedule then, okay?

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.154
Yeah.

00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:24.614
And check if there's
a general hospital nearby.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.575
I'll look it up right now.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:28.493
All right, then.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.247
Time's tight,
so let's go down there to look around

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.374
and start filming right away.

00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:35.876
Yes, Director Lee.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:38.587
You've changed, Director Lee.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:40.464
You're all grown up.

00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:42.174
So freaking adorable.

00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:44.801
She's filming in Andong first

00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:46.386
and then back over in Gangwon-do.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.722
We won't see you for a while then.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.434
When did you get so good with the knife?

00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:54.895
Ugh. I used to be bad at it.

00:30:54.978 --> 00:30:57.355
Then one day you got good, just like that?

00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:02.569
No, I just kept doing it until I got it.
Cut up some of my fingers on the way.

00:31:02.652 --> 00:31:05.197
But if you don't give up and keep at it,

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.448
then…

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:10.202
…you get to do that.

00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:13.705
Whoa! That's seriously badass.

00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:14.831
That was pretty cool.

00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:17.167
I must take up after Auntie.
I never give up either.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.752
Ooh. I can see that.

00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:20.462
You're more like her than I am.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:22.255
No, you're just like her too.

00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:24.674
Remember that sports day
in elementary school?

00:31:24.758 --> 00:31:27.844
Auntie yelled at those people
who whispered behind my back

00:31:27.928 --> 00:31:29.513
because I didn't have a mom.

00:31:29.596 --> 00:31:31.223
Mmm. That's right!

00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:33.809
Oh, come on. Don't remind me.

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:36.478
Those people were the worst.

00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:40.273
And your daughter Gyoyeong
always gets mad for me,

00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:42.734
fights for me, and cries for me too.

00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:43.902
Back then and even now.

00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:46.238
That's me, Gwak Gyoyeong!

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.616
When I was a kid,
genetics just meant illness.

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:51.660
But watching you and Auntie

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:55.705
made me realize that genetics
could be something really warm.

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:57.666
Eat that before it gets cold.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.501
Auntie.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:02.254
Will you come visit me in Gangwon-do?

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.506
Don't you want to see me act?

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.593
Oh my. Oh.

00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:10.720
Of course I do!

00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:12.681
Of course I want to see it!

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.683
Then could you come with my dad?

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.519
I really want both of you to see me.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.687
Of course I will.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.106
I'll definitely go and see you.

00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:25.026
- Oh, I love it!
- This is so exciting!

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.737
Eat everything,
down to the last bite. Okay?

00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.447
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:31.491
- I'm Bu Seungwon.
- Yes, hello.

00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:34.035
- Nice to meet you.
- This is our director, Lee Jeha.

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.120
Hello.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.205
Shall we go inside?

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.290
- Shall we?
- Yes.

00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:41.668
I'll handle things here. You can go.

00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:43.545
Let's go in together.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.589
You're not even good at talking.
You're no help.

00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:48.300
Just go and check out the location, okay?

00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:50.051
- All right.
- Hey, Director.

00:32:51.344 --> 00:32:53.638
I'm not giving you time for a date.
This is work.

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:55.473
Got it.

00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:01.521
ANDONG
THE CENTER OF KOREA'S SPIRITUAL CULTURE

00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:05.609
Hey, Daeum. Are you here yet?

00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.527
<i>I'll send you the address. See you there.</i>

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.828
- Hello.
- You're here.

00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:18.205
Yes, hi.

00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:21.416
Daeum, you're with me.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:25.795
Hong, you take Junbyung
and check out the site.

00:33:25.879 --> 00:33:28.465
Take some photos too, okay? Let's go.

00:33:28.548 --> 00:33:29.591
Jeha…

00:33:32.177 --> 00:33:34.012
Well, l-let's move.

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:36.473
So what can I do to help?

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:37.557
Just follow me.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.812
Give me the camcorder. I'll film you.

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:48.193
This thing ended up
playing a big part in our movie.

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:51.404
Of course.
It's a very useful camcorder, you know.

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:54.991
Go up to that tree over there.

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.293
Hello.

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:07.629
I'm the rookie actress, Lee Daeum.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:10.799
Yes, hello.

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:14.135
Mr. Lee,
let's do a little roleplay.

00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:17.013
I'm a super famous actress

00:34:17.097 --> 00:34:21.101
and you're sadly
a very washed-up director.

00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:22.852
Then should I

00:34:23.478 --> 00:34:25.021
beg you or something?

00:34:25.105 --> 00:34:26.314
That's perfect.

00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:30.110
Hello, Ms. Lee.

00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.486
Fancy seeing you here.

00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:36.032
I didn't have time to read your script.

00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:38.326
Oh, so you didn't read it.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.078
Cut, cut, cut!

00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.997
Come on, Mr. Lee.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.873
You call that acting?

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:47.961
- You need to be more desperate.
- Okay.

00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:49.796
Do you understand the emotion?

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:50.880
<i>Ms. Lee!</i>

00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:54.175
<i>Could you please be in my movie?</i>

00:34:54.259 --> 00:34:56.594
I don't want to.

00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:58.930
Could you at least read my script?

00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:00.515
I'm too busy.

00:35:01.391 --> 00:35:03.143
Hmm. In that case…

00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:06.104
forget the movie. Let's go on a date.

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:08.815
NAKGANGMULGIL PARK

00:35:08.898 --> 00:35:09.899
Oh.

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.776
That's you, Mr. Lee.

00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:15.071
And that's you right next to me.

00:35:15.155 --> 00:35:18.491
Should we take this path
and go all the way up there?

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.377
Should we make a wish together?

00:35:37.344 --> 00:35:38.845
Wow, this place is great.

00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:43.266
Security majors like me
can breeze past this.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.227
Oh.

00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:49.564
Ha. I'm fine.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:53.568
- Need a hand?
- Oh…

00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:54.986
Thank you.

00:35:57.947 --> 00:35:59.866
Oh, man.

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:04.120
I did this all the time
when I was in special ops--

00:36:04.204 --> 00:36:05.246
We have a lot to see.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.374
- Hurry and keep up.
- Okay.

00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:11.961
Actually,
did we look over there yet?

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:13.046
We already did.

00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:14.756
Just come with me, okay?

00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:17.759
We're totally being used.

00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:21.137
What is it?

00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:23.139
No, it's nothing.

00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:34.067
Even the weather

00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:37.362
is on our side today, isn't it?

00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.072
It is.

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:43.368
But I think…

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:46.705
we pushed it a bit far.
Let's stop here for today.

00:36:47.789 --> 00:36:48.790
Mm-mmm.

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:53.002
You're stopping here
when you see that beautiful thing?

00:36:53.086 --> 00:36:55.004
Yes. We can't go there.

00:36:55.088 --> 00:36:56.214
Mm-mmm.

00:36:57.465 --> 00:37:00.552
Let's just go halfway. Please?

00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:03.138
Come on!

00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:08.059
What should we do
once we finish this movie?

00:37:08.143 --> 00:37:09.519
I don't know, maybe…

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.312
Well…

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.606
I think I'd like whatever we do.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.817
You just like me, don't you?

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.445
Yes, that's right.

00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:21.072
So do I.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.241
But still…

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.702
there's something I really want to do.

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:28.997
If I make it to the end of filming,

00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:31.124
could you do it with me?

00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:35.545
What is it?

00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:38.047
I can't tell you that now.

00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.050
- Okay, now I'm scared.
- I'm going to do well.

00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:45.305
I'm going to do so well
so that can happen.

00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:29.891
We're going to start now!

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.309
Wait, hang on!

00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.269
Hey, Director Lee. Say a few words first.

00:38:33.353 --> 00:38:34.687
Everyone!

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:37.440
Mr. Lee has something to say!

00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:38.608
Here, come on.

00:38:39.192 --> 00:38:41.444
- A round of applause, everyone!
- Wow!

00:38:41.528 --> 00:38:42.695
You're so cool!

00:38:44.364 --> 00:38:45.573
Come on.

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:57.085
You never change, do you?

00:38:59.462 --> 00:39:02.924
We've made it this far
thanks to all of you.

00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:05.468
Keep up the good work

00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:07.637
until we finish filming.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.722
Thank you.

00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:20.149
And lastly…

00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:23.403
When I say "<i>Love in White</i>,"
you say "Let's go!"

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:24.904
You? Really?

00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:26.573
<i>Love in White</i>!

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:29.868
Let's go!

00:39:45.258 --> 00:39:47.051
Back here at last.

00:39:47.927 --> 00:39:49.762
- I'll go check in.
- Wait.

00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:52.599
Could you get me a wheelchair, Mr. Lim?

00:39:52.682 --> 00:39:54.684
A wheelchair? Why? Are you unwell?

00:39:54.767 --> 00:39:56.019
Want to sit here?

00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:57.270
No, no.

00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:58.688
Could you just get me one?

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:01.608
Ah. Oh, okay.

00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:10.408
Take one here. Take lots of photos.

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:12.827
You look great, Gyo!
Gotta get this on camera.

00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:14.037
You look gorgeous.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.164
Hotter than a supermodel!

00:40:16.998 --> 00:40:18.124
Above the ocean!

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.168
This one's a masterpiece!

00:40:23.463 --> 00:40:25.840
<i>I love you, Gyoyeong!</i>

00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:27.759
<i>I love you, Lee Daeum!</i>

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.180
That was no easy task.

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.848
It was a masterpiece, though!

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:35.600
It's hard to take a masterpiece.

00:40:35.683 --> 00:40:36.893
- It was so hard.
- It's hard.

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.604
It really feels like we're on a trip.

00:40:40.355 --> 00:40:41.397
I know, right?

00:40:42.482 --> 00:40:44.734
We never got to go
on a proper trip together.

00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:47.195
No. Actually, scratch that.

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:50.448
It doesn't just feel like one.
We really are on a trip.

00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:57.622
Thanks for coming on this trip with me.

00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:00.333
You look gorgeous.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:03.753
- Are you not cold?
- I'm not.

00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:05.838
- You don't need to zip this up?
- No, I'm fine.

00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:09.050
Lee Daeum!

00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:13.096
Nam Jaein?

00:41:16.474 --> 00:41:18.726
I thought you didn't have a shoot, Jaein.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.228
No, I don't have one.

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:22.981
I came here for you.

00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:43.209
HAND WARMER

00:41:56.889 --> 00:42:00.018
You came all the way here from Seoul
just to give me these?

00:42:00.727 --> 00:42:01.811
You two made me

00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:04.272
look like an idiot, you know?

00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:10.236
Well, Jaein, I mean…

00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.738
You two are so weird.

00:42:12.572 --> 00:42:13.990
Daeum,

00:42:14.574 --> 00:42:16.701
you vanish out of nowhere
and drive me nuts.

00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:19.037
And Gyoyeong, you…

00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.205
Jaein, that was…

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:25.126
Watching you two look out for each other,

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.712
I wanted to do that too.

00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:31.716
Maybe copy you, even just a little.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.803
I wanted to be…

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.473
friends with you guys too.

00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:43.603
But then you both
just disappeared so suddenly.

00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:48.357
And I felt so stupid thinking
I could've been friends with you.

00:43:04.499 --> 00:43:05.500
Jaein.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.046
When I first found out that I was sick,

00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:14.842
it was hard for me to give up everything
and be admitted to the hospital.

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:18.137
That's why I just wanted
to disappear instead.

00:43:21.766 --> 00:43:24.685
But I guess I was selfish
thinking like that. I'm sorry.

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:29.524
I had no idea about that

00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:31.818
and I…

00:43:34.195 --> 00:43:37.073
I said life must be so exciting for you.

00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:39.367
I said that awful stuff.

00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.376
But you didn't know.

00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.422
And you came here for me now.

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:56.926
It's okay.

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:00.096
We both messed up. It's okay.

00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:03.266
I'm so sorry.

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:06.602
Why do you have to be sick?

00:44:06.686 --> 00:44:07.687
Why?

00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:11.399
I'm so sorry.

00:44:17.155 --> 00:44:18.698
I'm sorry, Daeum.

00:44:20.992 --> 00:44:22.743
It's all right, Jaein.

00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:24.745
<i>Daeum!</i>

00:44:27.707 --> 00:44:29.208
- <i>Don't be sick.</i>
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:44:31.377 --> 00:44:33.212
<i>Look over here. One, two, three!</i>

00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:37.300
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:38.718
Scene 73, shot 1, take 1.

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:41.470
Ready.

00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:43.181
Action!

00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:03.784
How about we try a tighter shot this time?

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.287
Yes, I think tighter than usual
would be better.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.663
Okay, then. Let's move!

00:45:07.747 --> 00:45:08.873
Bring the camera over.

00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:10.124
Yes, sir.

00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.084
- Seonmi!
- So, Daeum.

00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:15.504
Since the camera's
coming in tighter for this scene…

00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:17.590
This is an important scene,

00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:19.842
- so let's keep the noise under control.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:21.344
Aren't you cold?

00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:22.428
Oh? Hey, Minhee.

00:45:23.346 --> 00:45:25.389
Seoyoung's not even here
and you're helping out?

00:45:25.473 --> 00:45:26.474
Of course I'm helping.

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.018
- Thank you!
- No problem.

00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:36.859
Cut! Let's try it one more time.

00:45:36.943 --> 00:45:38.903
The sun's setting.
Let's open the aperture a bit.

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:40.238
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:46.911
Never mind.

00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:50.122
You're so miserable,
it's not worth the fuss.

00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:09.517
Cut! That's good.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.060
We're good to go!

00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:12.937
That was even better than the test shoot.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.647
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:17.692
Thank you, Ms. Chae.

00:46:18.526 --> 00:46:20.152
How are you this good?

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:26.659
Okay, the final full shot
will be at that size.

00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:29.328
Understood.

00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:33.040
- Did you get towels ready for drying off?
- Yes.

00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:34.750
We should push through in one go.

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:36.127
Spray some rain here.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.253
Pardon?

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:39.297
I want to test it.

00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:41.132
Spray some rain, please.

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:56.063
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.169
Let's skip the rain.

00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:20.671
Uh, I'll be okay for a minute or two.

00:47:20.755 --> 00:47:23.049
No. We're shooting without the rain.

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:34.602
You can do this.

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.942
You can do a good job.

00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:05.341
Cut.

00:48:05.424 --> 00:48:06.759
That's a cut.

00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:11.889
Daeum.

00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:13.682
- Yes?
- Are you okay?

00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:14.892
I'm okay.

00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:17.353
Daeum.

00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:21.607
Uh, that last take…

00:48:22.983 --> 00:48:24.527
Let's try it again.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.779
Are you sure you can do that?

00:48:26.862 --> 00:48:28.072
Of course.

00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:29.990
I can do ten or a hundred more takes.

00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:32.118
Okay, then. Let's try it once more.

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:36.080
Let's do this!

00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:37.415
Let's do this!

00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:46.382
Let's go.

00:48:48.509 --> 00:48:49.593
Ready.

00:48:53.722 --> 00:48:54.849
Action!

00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:57.560
How was it today?

00:48:57.643 --> 00:48:59.645
I was super happy again today.

00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:03.023
Mr. Lee,

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.401
did you just go with that take
because of me

00:49:05.484 --> 00:49:07.027
even though you weren't satisfied?

00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:10.573
You even gave up on the rain.
I feel a little bad.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.077
I never just brush off
your acting like that.

00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:17.705
We made a really great scene today.

00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.040
That's a relief.

00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:24.086
Hang on.

00:49:25.421 --> 00:49:26.839
You have a fever.

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.216
Let me get Dr. Kim.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.426
Go inside first.

00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:15.429
INCOMING CALL
FUNERAL DIRECTOR, KIM JIHO

00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:27.858
Hello?

00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:29.026
<i>Ms. Lee Daeum?</i>

00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:31.946
Yes?

00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:34.657
<i>We met at Hankuk National</i>
<i>University Hospital, and you texted me.</i>

00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:37.660
Yes.

00:50:37.743 --> 00:50:40.454
<i>I looked into what you asked.</i>
<i>Is this a good time to talk?</i>

00:50:40.538 --> 00:50:41.539
Oh…

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.584
Well, I'm actually quite busy right now.

00:50:45.668 --> 00:50:48.212
Can I call you back later?

00:51:04.937 --> 00:51:06.480
Yes, coming!

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:45.894
How much longer is the shoot?

00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:48.480
Just a few more days.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.610
I don't think it's possible.

00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:55.654
Sorry?

00:51:55.738 --> 00:51:57.323
Well, let's just…

00:51:58.282 --> 00:52:00.159
move her to the hospital after a few days.

00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:01.910
Okay.

00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:14.715
Is there anything I can do right now?

00:52:18.052 --> 00:52:20.387
You're already doing more than enough.

00:53:36.422 --> 00:53:38.257
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

00:53:44.972 --> 00:53:47.558
Don't say things you don't mean, Hyunsang.

00:53:49.518 --> 00:53:51.270
You're tired of me being sick.

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.147
You're sick of me, right?

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.065
Then just leave.

00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:56.859
Go!

00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:58.068
Get lost!

00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:00.404
Gyuwon.

00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:02.698
Could I have a quick word with you both?

00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:08.162
I wanted to talk about the ending.

00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:10.330
Oh, is that so?

00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:14.293
I had a hunch
when Hyunsang didn't leave for Seoul.

00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:18.172
Mr. Lee.

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.507
Are you changing the ending?

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:24.595
Yes, I'm not going with the ending
that brings Hyunsang and Junghwa to ruin.

00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:27.556
Then does he go back to Gyuwon
like the original?

00:54:30.017 --> 00:54:32.102
Yes, he goes back. He goes back and…

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.774
What if it goes like the original
and Gyuwon doesn't die?

00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.234
Ah.

00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:44.323
- Well done, everyone.
- Great work!

00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.492
- You did an awesome job.
- Thank you.

00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:50.829
It won't be big, but dinner is on me.

00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:53.665
Wow, Mr. Ji. Are you serious?

00:54:53.749 --> 00:54:55.167
My man!

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:56.752
I have to speak with Mr. Lee.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.648
Mr. Lee.

00:55:18.941 --> 00:55:20.442
Why are you here? We're done today.

00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:21.777
You should get some rest.

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.875
I want Gyuwon to die.

00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:38.460
Sorry?

00:55:38.544 --> 00:55:41.129
I said, I want Gyuwon to die.

00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:44.258
I don't want her to die.

00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:47.135
I want her to live
with Hyunsang by her side.

00:55:48.053 --> 00:55:51.473
You're only saying that
because you don't want me to die.

00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:55.811
But didn't you want Gyuwon to live too,
like in the original?

00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:57.521
I did at first.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.023
But not anymore.

00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:04.111
Now that I've lived as her,

00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:08.115
I really want to portray Gyuwon's death.

00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:11.660
When I read my mother's original draft,

00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:15.747
I felt this overwhelming desire to live.

00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:18.000
And now…

00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.418
Yeah, that's right.

00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:22.254
When I look at you,

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.756
I feel the same way.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.134
Does love disappear when someone dies?

00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:31.597
If you're rewriting the ending
because you want to avoid something,

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.681
don't avoid it.

00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:36.893
If love disappears because of death,
that's too cruel for me.

00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:41.481
We should believe that,
if their love was real,

00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:45.694
it will last forever
even after Gyuwon dies.

00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.949
Isn't that what our movie is about?

00:57:22.856 --> 00:57:24.024
Thank you…

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.943
for today.

00:57:40.207 --> 00:57:41.625
Hey, Junbyung.

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.628
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:47.172
Is there something wrong?

00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:49.424
Daeum needs to go to the hospital.

00:57:49.508 --> 00:57:51.093
Of course. How many days?

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:52.386
I'm not sure yet.

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:54.054
I'll let you know when I'm there.

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:55.180
I'm sorry!

00:57:58.183 --> 00:57:59.184
Attention, everyone.

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.729
We'll have to pause shooting
for a few days.

00:58:02.813 --> 00:58:04.189
Hope you all understand.

00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:06.566
No worries.
That means we can get some rest.

00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:10.696
I'll get some inserts today, then.
There's a lot to film.

00:58:11.196 --> 00:58:13.573
Don't worry, I'm a pro at inserts.

00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:15.784
I'll go and check the lighting.

00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:17.369
Yes, sounds good.

00:58:17.452 --> 00:58:19.162
Camera team, get ready for inserts!

00:58:19.246 --> 00:58:20.372
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir.

00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:28.714
GRAPE 100

00:58:53.113 --> 00:58:54.573
That was a good sleep.

00:58:55.574 --> 00:58:56.616
Are you okay?

00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:02.164
Looks like your meds are all in.
I'll get the doctor.

00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:07.294
It's not all in yet.

00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.015
<i>Why didn't you come visit?</i>

00:59:20.098 --> 00:59:21.933
Daeum waited for you.

00:59:22.017 --> 00:59:25.312
I'm not one to chase around my kid
while she's at work.

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:26.980
Did she wait for long?

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:29.733
Please come next time.
The shoot's almost over.

00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:31.193
Right.

00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:32.986
It's almost over, isn't it?

00:59:34.613 --> 00:59:35.781
It went by so quickly.

00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:38.283
Shorter than I thought.

00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:45.081
You haven't seen her act yet, have you?

00:59:46.124 --> 00:59:47.334
I have.

00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:49.711
I've seen more than enough.

00:59:49.795 --> 00:59:52.506
In the five years
she was at this hospital,

00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:54.090
she put up a camera in her room.

00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.176
She's laughing one moment

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:58.595
then suddenly crying the next,

00:59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.347
and then starts yelling.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:03.183
Grabbing her pillow
like she's ready to kill someone.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.310
I've seen quite a lot.

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:07.896
I don't know if you can
call that acting, but yes.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.817
When she was acting,

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.568
she forgot about everything else.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.987
She smiled a lot,

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.031
and she was happy.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.785
She's like that on set too, right?

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:27.833
That's all I need.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.378
If only she could keep smiling,

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.879
that's enough for me.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.637
But I realized that far too late.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.516
Mr. Lee.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.980
I hope you don't see Daeum's time
as only pain

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:52.899
and that…

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:54.818
this is not too hard on you.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.616
That's all I can say to you.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.047
Yes, Daeum.

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.383
I'm on the skywalk, but I don't see you.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.468
<i>Face the other way.</i>

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:25.515
<i>No, not that way. Down here.</i>

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.434
<i>I'm right here.</i>

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:37.027
Why are you outside? It's cold.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.863
- Come back inside.
- <i>I don't want to.</i>

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.573
Mr. Lee.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.783
Stay there for a bit.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.327
Why?

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.454
<i>I have something to say to you,</i>

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:50.624
and I wanted to say it
from just about this distance.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.084
Okay.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.878
What is it?

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.881
Is my dad sad?

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.092
No, he said

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:02.928
seeing you smile…

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.013
<i>Yes, your smile</i>

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.057
<i>is enough for him.</i>

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.269
Like this?

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.150
Yes, like that.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:23.990
Looking up from here…

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.036
I finally understand now.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.124
That…

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.544
the one waving from below

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:40.882
is the one that is

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:43.426
sadder and hurting more.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.721
What are you saying?

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.891
<i>When many years go by</i>

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:55.021
and he can't see Gyuwon anymore
through that glass,

01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:00.902
I hope Hyunsang doesn't stand here
for too long.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:07.742
I don't have much time left.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.914
So why don't we rehearse?

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.043
Rehearse what?

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:18.962
<i>We should rehearse</i>

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.131
saying goodbye

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.217
without hurting too much.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.529
I have something to say to you too.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:51.119
I…

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:57.959
wanted to say that at this distance.

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.342
I love you, Lee Daeum.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:31.034
I love you, Lee Jeha.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.666
<i>At first I thought, "Am I really dying?"</i>

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.543
<i>I kept thinking about death.</i>

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.878
<i>But then I met you, Gyuwon.</i>

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:25.672
Daeum.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.216
Break a leg.

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:31.469
<i>And I thought, "So that's how you live."</i>

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:34.222
<i>You just need to live each day</i>

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.141
<i>as you've been given.</i>

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.476
That's right.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.061
Shamelessly.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.480
Yes, shamelessly.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.361
<i>It's the imperfection</i>
<i>that makes it special.</i>

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.738
<i>I think it'll be a pretty decent movie.</i>

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:54.242
<i>Even when it's over,</i>
<i>it'll feel like it hasn't ended yet.</i>

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:55.326
Ready.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.497
<i>That's why I'm going to miss it.</i>

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:01.958
Action!

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:05.920

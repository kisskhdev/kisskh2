OUR MOVIE

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.199
ANY RESEMBLANCE
TO ACTUAL PEOPLE, PLACES,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.450
OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS
IS COINCIDENTAL.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.701
CHILD ACTORS WERE
ALWAYS SUPERVISED

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:35.953
AND SAFELY FILMED
UNDER GUIDELINES.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.251
Thank you.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.672
I'm looking forward to this.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:53.971
Are we in the wrong place?

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:57.099
Are you worried?

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.685
No, I'm not worried.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.687
Popcorn. Have your popcorn.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:09.611
- When did you buy that?
- I bought it a while back.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.488
I haven't seen it before. When?

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.740
People are coming in.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.868
Looks like you are worried.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:19.246
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.832
<i>That sound of the waves</i>
<i>breaking endlessly?</i>

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.465
<i>Yeah, I hear it.</i>

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.640
LEE DAEUM

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.350
Hey, get up.

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.103
I've never fallen asleep
during a movie before.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.604
Like I took a sleeping pill.

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.898
Let's go.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.903
I think we might be screwed.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.156
Don't lump me in.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.532
I'm fine.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.992
You're the one who's screwed.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.832
Really? You're bailing on me now?

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.293
You should take responsibility too.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:07.711
I don't want to.

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:09.546
Depends on what you do next.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.762
EPISODE 12

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:17.929
EPISODE 1

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.726
LET'S LIVE
LET'S LIVE IN THE MOMENT

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.007
On days when you're sick…

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.264
when your heart feels especially heavy,

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.518
I want to watch
your favorite movies with you.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.853
So you can forget the pain,

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.439
at least in that moment.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.775
I'd love that.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:17.739
We can't just forget everything
and pretend nothing will happen.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:18.824
But even so,

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.743
we can still be happy, like right now.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.330
So let's not rehearse

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.707
saying goodbye.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.129
This moment is too precious for that.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:34.798
Don't you think?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.718
The Daeum in front of me right now.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.098
The movie I'm making with her.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.811
And the love I'm sharing with her.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.981
Those are already more than enough.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.777
In that case…

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:58.697
Mr. Lee,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.741
please stay with me.

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:05.036
Even on days
when I'm not smiling like this.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.873
Don't go running away.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:09.791
I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.169
I've got nowhere to go anyway.

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:16.923
You know,

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:18.967
I want to be happy right now.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:22.721
I want to love you
with everything I have, right now.

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:27.517
Daeum.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.979
How about we write

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.815
our movie's ending based on this feeling?

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.152
Based on this feeling?

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:38.737
Yes.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.114
The way you and I feel

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.992
right this moment.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.982
GYUWON: I WISH I COULD BREAK
APART AND COME TOGETHER AGAIN.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.484
THE END.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.780
Oh, you bastard.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:26.159
How could I not get excited
by an ending like this?

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:29.830
Let's submit it
to all the festivals next year.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.374
I don't care about the money,

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.167
but I want trophies.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.670
Okay, then I'll shoot it like this.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.840
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.758
What do you like about being a director?

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.093
Just tell me one thing.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.429
What do I like?

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.767
What do I like…

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.061
I knew it. Nothing.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.065
That's even more appealing.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.192
What's she talking about?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.320
I'll go and prep now.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.494
As long as we don't go over budget,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.122
let's see this thing through.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.666
I'll give you everything
that I can scrape up.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:15.750
Okay.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.300
Junbyung.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.635
Oh, hello.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.429
Daeum is here, right?

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.639
Yes, she got here earlier
and is resting now.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:30.724
Mmm.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.686
Mind if I deliver this to her?

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:37.314
Of course. She's going to love that.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.483
What is this, by the way?

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.902
It's abalone porridge.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.570
She's had trouble digesting lately.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:47.073
- Ah.
- And could you give this to her as well?

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:50.619
You're a good manager.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:51.995
Just doing what I can.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:53.538
Take care, then.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.967
Guess I'm getting a free meal.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.054
Wow, abalone porridge.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.143
Oh. You're eating carbs.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.436
Yeah, I eat carbs now.

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:18.647
Why keep avoiding something so good?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.776
It's great to see you eating well.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.444
I broke up with Jungwoo.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.572
I didn't want to feel
even a shred of loneliness.

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:30.075
I was afraid that I would drown in it.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.912
That's why I think I used him.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.875
It took me too long
to admit that honestly.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.422
I hurt someone else
while trying to run from it,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.258
without knowing I'd end up
hurting myself too.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:49.803
But now…

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.389
I'm going to fall into it.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.726
I'm going to let myself
sink into loneliness.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.188
Maybe then I'll learn how to come back up.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:02.941
I think you'll swim out of it just fine.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.444
Even if you fall into that fear again,

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:08.738
you'll break free from it

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.907
splashing like this.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.200
Splish-splash.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:15.203
Calm and smooth.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.122
You think so?

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.374
Yes. Believe me.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.626
You know, Daeum…

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.671
you sound very trustworthy right now.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.590
That's exactly the kind of
trustworthy person you are too.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.221
Go ahead and eat.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:35.140
Okay.

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:36.224
This too.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:42.939
Tough scene, isn't it?

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.526
Hyunsang lives on
without Gyuwon after all.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.613
Yes, I was curious to see how Hyunsang
would live in a world without Gyuwon.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.198
I think he would cry.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.660
He won't be able to keep it in.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.371
No, let's not cry here. Let's just…

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.582
try it without tears.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:03.126
But this place
is full of memories with Gyuwon.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:07.255
Do you think he'd be okay
being here all alone?

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:10.216
No, he wouldn't be okay.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.219
But maybe some love makes you okay

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.347
by simply holding on to it forever.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.225
Maybe…

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:22.854
that kind of love gives you
the strength to carry on.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:29.903
Jeez.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.740
You're not out here for air.
You're waiting for Mr. Lee.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.409
Busted.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:38.703
What's taking him so long?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.789
You really like him, huh?

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.125
Yeah.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.463
Hey, Doc?

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.547
Yeah.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:51.925
Why isn't my dad coming?

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.009
Why?

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.012
- Are you upset?
- No.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.556
I just wanted him to see me

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.476
filming at least once.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.061
He can watch

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.356
the movie later when it comes out.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.983
You can watch it together then.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.569
Yeah.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.279
Ah.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.907
Ah.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.033
Mr. Lee!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.207
Why are you outside? It's cold.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.709
I came out to wait because I missed you.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.044
You really missed me, huh?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.132
Man, I need some soju.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.258
Let's go get some.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.426
Never seen Mr. Lee run before.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.011
Okay, let's go.

00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:39.430
Hmm? Why are they all leaving?

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:40.932
Let's go.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:42.892
So you waited for me?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:44.853
Yes.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.105
- My hand is warm, isn't it?
- Yeah.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.108
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.903
- Goodness, welcome.
- Hello.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.780
- Hello there.
- Wow.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:57.699
Two more glasses here, please!

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:58.992
- Okay.
- Wow.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.791
You're so good
at taking care of people, Ms. Yu.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.084
I am?

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:12.088
You've especially been
looking out for Junbyung in subtle ways.

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.339
What?

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.924
No, I haven't!

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:18.678
Well, you take
really good care of Mr. Ji too!

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:19.929
It's just like that.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.516
Hang on. Oh.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.729
Oh, I'm really sorry.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.022
I didn't read the room.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.273
- Huh?
- I'm really sorry.

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.608
No! You don't have to do that!

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.985
- I'm so sorry.
- Why are you doing this?

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.862
Man, this is nuts.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.405
- Oh, dear.
- What are you doing?

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:42.452
It's not <i>Love in White</i>,
it's <i>Love in Everywhere</i>.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.162
I know, right? Wow.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.830
Great work, everyone.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.207
- Great work!
- Great work!

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.709
- Great work!
- Great work!

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:50.835
Oh, man.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:54.505
Hey, this isn't fair.
You totally left the two of us out.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.926
Well, Director Lee ran off
without even looking back.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.053
We had no choice but to open some beers!

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.512
We had no choice.

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.014
Still, don't treat us like outcasts.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.808
All right, Director Lee.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.436
Try remembering when you were
the youngest in the production team.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.271
Why would you bring that up?

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.357
You just happened to be there back then.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:15.526
Anyway, I don't regret
selling the building at all.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.070
I'm fine with it.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.821
I'm totally fine. I swear.

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.574
Seungwon, have a drink while you talk.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.284
Oh my, our director.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.619
I really am fine.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.496
- I know you're fine.
- I really am.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.831
Come on. Let's feast! And drink!

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.669
Ah!

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.471
Ah…

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.640
You didn't have to pay! Come on.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:47.392
This is no big deal for me.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.228
Can't believe I drank on the doctor's tab.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.771
Mr. Bu can buy the second round.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:54.274
- Yeah, I'll buy the next round.
- Really?

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:56.484
- Of course I will.
- Daeum.

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.653
There's a really great place nearby.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.699
Are you all right?

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.618
Yeah, I'm all right.
I only drank a little…

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.415
Is there anything you need?

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.002
No.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.753
Mr. Lee.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.340
When I find a really good book,

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.925
I start to feel sad.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.679
I keep checking how many pages are left,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.598
and try to slow down to make it last.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.727
That's exactly how I feel right now.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.688
It feels weird

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.107
knowing that the last shoot is coming.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.655
Then let's not slow down
and read it to the very end.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.035
And when we finish that last page,

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.831
we go looking
for the next great story to enjoy.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:53.416
You're right.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:56.294
That's how I should think.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.715
When we first met,

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:03.968
I wondered how long
that bold energy would last.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.430
It never goes away.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.599
You never get tired.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.225
I told you

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.812
that I'd finish this movie no matter what.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.567
It must've been difficult
getting all the way here.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.777
Mmm.

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:23.780
Going through a difficult time

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.616
and going through the bumpy unpaved road

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:28.659
actually made me happy.

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.449
Oh, Mr. Kim.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.034
Don't get up.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:18.251
The sun is shining
as brightly as you today, Gyuwon.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.005
Around the time we began filming,

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.591
I went to the hospital.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.678
They told me my cancer was back.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.721
Pardon?

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.686
Since I got a second chance at life,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:42.024
I thought I should spend it making up
for everything I did wrong to my wife,

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.236
but I don't think I have much time left.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.738
What are you saying?

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.784
At first I thought, "Am I really dying?"

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:54.287
I kept thinking about death.

00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.456
But then I met you, Gyuwon.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:01.752
And I thought, "So that's how you live."

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.547
I learned that from you.

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:10.052
You just need to live each day

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.347
as you've been given.

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:26.360
That's right.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.196
Shamelessly.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.323
Yes, shamelessly.

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:34.410
Let's live another warm, shining day

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.538
just like the sunlight.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.585
Mr. Kim, we're ready for you.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:43.669
Shall we?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.255
Okay. Let's go, Daughter.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.924
Let's go, Father.

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:49.967
Open your eyes. Look up.

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:55.431
Done.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.059
What do you think?
Beautifully sick again, huh?

00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.478
Yes. How do you do it, Ms. Jo?

00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.189
It's like I'm pretty but sick.
I'm sick but pretty.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:06.567
You're the best, Ms. Jo!

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:07.860
Daeum!

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.654
He's here.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:15.868
This is Mr. Kim Hyuncheol,
he plays Gyuwon's father.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:16.994
I've heard a lot about you.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.996
Dad!

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.164
Dad!

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.170
Don't jump around.

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.422
- You're not cold?
- No.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:30.800
Okay.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:35.513
This filming thing is not easy, is it?

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.683
Still, this place is really nice.

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:42.937
But why'd you come so late?
You should've come earlier.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.231
Showing up on the last day,

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.691
just in time for the death scene?

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:49.902
Sorry.

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:51.946
Dad.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.739
Yeah?

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.742
The meds haven't been working lately,

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.953
so I didn't take any painkillers.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.788
I'll take them after this scene.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:02.957
You know how dazed they make me.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.377
Sure.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:08.838
That's okay.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.549
Not taking your meds isn't an emergency.

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.177
I'm here now.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.555
I'll be right here watching you,
so don't worry.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:18.848
It'll be okay.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:19.932
Okay.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.394
Thanks, Dad.

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.980
What? I should be the one thanking you.

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:29.150
I get to experience a movie set
thanks to you.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.027
Right? Aren't I such a great daughter?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.361
Of course.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.488
- Daeum!
- Oh.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.532
- I think I have to go.
- They need you.

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.200
Okay.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:41.787
Daeum.

00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:45.249
Break a leg.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.335
I'll see you later.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.464
Hurry up and go.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.562
What's with this weather?

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.439
The waves should be crashing

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.608
and the seagulls should be crying
on a day like this.

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:15.529
Mr. Lee.

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.283
I really love this ending.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:20.993
I do too.

00:19:21.077 --> 00:19:22.078
It's like…

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.830
the imperfection of it
that makes it special.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.249
I think it'll be a pretty decent movie.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.838
Even when it's over,
it'll feel like it hasn't ended yet.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:36.300
That's why I'm going to miss it.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.554
As long as Hyunsang remembers Gyuwon,

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.682
she won't disappear, right?

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:48.521
Yes. As long as Hyunsang remembers,
that love…

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:50.731
won't disappear.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.028
Remember how I swore
I was going to put love into this movie?

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.073
I did it.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.492
Yes, you really did.

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:06.455
Mr. Lee, there's something
I want to ask you.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.545
Could you hold off on calling "cut"
until I open my eyes again?

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:14.964
Okay, I'll do that.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.726
Let's go. Time to shoot the last scene.

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.771
Yes, shall we go get ready?

00:20:58.632 --> 00:20:59.633
Okay, let's do this.

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:06.724
<i>Love in White </i>final shoot.
Scene 117, take one.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.518
Ready.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.648
Action!

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:16.692
Do you hear that, Hyunsang?

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.070
That sound of the waves
breaking endlessly?

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:28.537
Yeah, I hear it.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:34.794
I wanted to make sure you knew
that you could be happy again, Jeha.

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:36.796
Yes, I know.

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:40.257
I can be happy again.

00:21:40.341 --> 00:21:41.509
You taught me that, Daeum.

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:45.304
Live the time that is yours, Jeha.

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:48.265
Live it fully and happily.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.228
I'll stay right here.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.856
In your heart, and in this sea.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:01.111
- You're right here, Daeum.
- Mmm.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:05.533
I'm going to keep breaking apart
and coming together

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.409
and breaking apart

00:22:08.035 --> 00:22:09.578
and coming together again.

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:38.274
Your dad…

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.528
He always pretends he's okay

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:45.197
and tries to act strong around you…

00:22:46.574 --> 00:22:49.285
…but he's actually
very scared and emotional.

00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:52.913
You didn't know, did you?

00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:54.832
Of course, I knew that.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:57.960
I caught him crying alone all the time.

00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:05.467
You see?

00:23:05.551 --> 00:23:07.845
That's what I worry about the most.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.639
What do we do with him?

00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:15.060
But after pretending to be okay
and strong so much,

00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:16.770
he actually did become strong.

00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:19.356
So you don't have to worry, Mom.

00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:21.567
That's good to hear.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.779
Were you scared when you had to leave?

00:23:28.782 --> 00:23:29.825
I don't know.

00:23:31.452 --> 00:23:34.747
I don't know if what I felt was fear,

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.417
or pain, or maybe even happiness.

00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:42.212
I guess it was

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.507
all of them at once, you know?

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:48.594
I missed you so much, Mom.

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.305
It's still so vivid.

00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:53.766
And so sad.

00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:02.942
I know.

00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:06.779
I know that you missed me…

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.741
and that you were sad.

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.160
I feel all of it.

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:14.995
You feel all of it?

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:22.670
Every bit.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:26.048
All of it.

00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:29.593
So you knew everything.

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:32.888
Daeum.

00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:35.182
Are you scared?

00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.393
Hmm…

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.439
I wanted to write my own ending.

00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:48.153
And because of that, I found both
someone to love and something to love.

00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:53.242
But now that I feel
it's almost time to let go…

00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.288
I'm a little scared.

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.347
Daeum.

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:17.891
Don't be too scared.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.437
Okay.

00:25:34.658 --> 00:25:35.659
Cut.

00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:37.494
Okay.

00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:40.414
That was an OK!

00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:43.834
Oh, she was acting.

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.002
That scared me.

00:25:45.586 --> 00:25:47.421
Thank you for all your hard work!

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:49.381
That's a wrap!

00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:53.343
Great work.

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:58.098
Goodness.

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:10.903
Great job.

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:12.738
- Well done, Daeum.
- Great work!

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.502
Thank you.

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:41.350
Daeum, come out.

00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:44.561
It's time to eat.

00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:00.494
- I'll go get some coffee.
- Sure.

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:21.390
Mr. Lee.

00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.059
I was just missing you.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:25.978
I miss you too.

00:27:27.104 --> 00:27:28.689
Have you eaten?

00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.482
I ate earlier,

00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:32.150
but my stomach has been off.

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:35.237
I need to eat again soon anyway.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.322
Don't force yourself and throw up.

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:39.741
Small portions, often. Okay?

00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:41.118
Okay.

00:27:41.201 --> 00:27:42.744
Are you pulling an all-nighter again?

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.706
No, I'm going to finish up early
and get some sleep.

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:47.332
Got something important tomorrow.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:50.794
You'll have to brace yourself for that.

00:27:51.378 --> 00:27:53.589
Okay, I'll brace myself for sure.

00:29:34.648 --> 00:29:35.941
- You're here.
- Hello.

00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:41.822
You can wear that.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:43.615
Oh, okay. Here.

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:51.039
Daeum, what's taking so long?

00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:52.582
I'll be right out!

00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:55.293
Jeez, what's with all the fuss
this morning?

00:29:56.878 --> 00:29:58.505
So what are you two doing today?

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:01.049
We're going on a date.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.592
Oh, right.

00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.265
A date…

00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:14.229
Ta-da!

00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:18.775
That's it?

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.820
You look stunning today.

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.324
See? He says I look stunning.

00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:27.784
All right.

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.037
Shall we go?

00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:31.997
Leave already.

00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:34.291
Hurry up and go.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:46.970
PYONGYANG COLD BUCKWHEAT NOODLES

00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:50.640
Mix it up.

00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:54.352
Bon appétit.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.694
Mmm.

00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:10.285
It tastes better plain.

00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:12.037
Okay.

00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:26.593
The coffee here is really good, Mr. Lee.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:34.976
Mr. Lee.

00:31:36.937 --> 00:31:40.148
You're always behind the camera.
I wanted to get you in front of one.

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.526
This feels a bit awkward.

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:44.986
Deal with it.

00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:48.406
Perfect. One, two, three!

00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:50.867
LOOK AT THE CAMERA

00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:54.538
You have to smile.

00:31:55.455 --> 00:31:56.456
I did smile.

00:31:57.624 --> 00:32:00.752
Wasting a handsome face like that
is a national disaster.

00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:02.963
One, two, three!

00:32:05.215 --> 00:32:06.758
One, two, three!

00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:15.142
CINEMA JONGNO

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:23.316
We saw one movie

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.568
and the sun is down.

00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:27.946
I know. The day feels too short.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:34.286
TIME TO EAT

00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:38.373
But the day isn't over yet.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:52.387
Want some help?

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.598
No, I can do it by myself.

00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:12.032
Here.

00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.252
No, no. Don't do that.

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:25.545
It'll be bad if you choke.

00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:27.047
Why not? This is my party trick.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.716
You laughed at me
when I did this here last time.

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.510
Not everyone can do this, so don't laugh.

00:33:37.057 --> 00:33:38.225
Jeez.

00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:40.185
I knew it. I told you so.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.686
Here.

00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:46.233
Eat before it goes cold.

00:33:46.816 --> 00:33:48.193
Can't skip <i>ramyeon</i>.

00:33:48.777 --> 00:33:50.403
Thank you for the meal.

00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.615
Ooh!

00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:57.827
Hmm.

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:09.881
Was this your first time making <i>ramyeon</i>?

00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:14.302
Wait, what?
The color is different from mine.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.430
I'll allow the <i>ramyeon</i>,
but not the entire seasoning packet.

00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:23.561
It's hard to make <i>ramyeon</i>
so plain like this, but…

00:34:23.645 --> 00:34:25.146
it's actually better.

00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:28.233
Go ahead and eat.

00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:34.614
Thank you for that, Mr. Lee.

00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:40.954
Over there.

00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:43.581
See that guy in the coat?

00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:45.542
With the rose.

00:35:05.729 --> 00:35:08.106
I think that flower is the problem.

00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:11.610
I bet he gave someone that flower
at the wrong time.

00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:15.614
Mmm. I don't think he got rejected
after offering the flower.

00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:18.533
I think he's the one who got it
at a time he shouldn't have.

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:20.201
Why do you think so?

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:21.369
He hesitated,

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:23.204
debating if he should leave it or not.

00:35:23.747 --> 00:35:25.165
He looked really sad too.

00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:28.043
Then who do you think gave it to him?

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.129
What do you think that person
did for a living?

00:35:31.212 --> 00:35:32.672
Not sure.

00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:34.341
But why did he hesitate?

00:35:34.424 --> 00:35:37.761
It looked like
he was very angry at himself.

00:35:38.887 --> 00:35:41.056
Where did he go after leaving the flower?

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.766
Maybe…

00:35:43.767 --> 00:35:46.269
to the one who made him let it go
in the first place.

00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:55.570
So you play imagination games too.

00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:01.368
When I was in the hospital,
I used to look outside

00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:04.788
and make up imaginary stories
about random people.

00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:05.955
Mmm.

00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:10.001
I also spent
a lot of time alone growing up.

00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:13.463
I ran out of books to read at home,

00:36:14.047 --> 00:36:15.882
and watched all the films I had.

00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:19.803
After that, the only thing left
was to keep thinking and imagining.

00:36:19.886 --> 00:36:22.347
It became a habit, then my job.

00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.183
I like hearing about your life.

00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:27.268
How have you lived,

00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:30.021
and how will you keep living?

00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:33.233
I can't even make <i>ramyeon</i> right,

00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:35.068
but thanks to you,

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.737
I think I'll live
trying to get better at it.

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.210
Imagination over!

00:36:54.087 --> 00:36:56.381
What? What did you imagine?

00:36:56.965 --> 00:36:59.759
Mm-mmm. I want to keep this one to myself.

00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:00.844
It's a secret.

00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:04.681
Ah. This is so nice.

00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:08.893
It's so nice being here
like this with you.

00:37:34.794 --> 00:37:36.212
Gyoyeong, you're here too.

00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:37.297
Yes.

00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:40.842
Yes? Oh, what? What are you doing here?

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.010
Pardon?

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.180
We were just being normal, you know.

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:47.557
It doesn't look normal.

00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:49.142
Ah.

00:37:51.603 --> 00:37:53.813
Gyoyeong is sleeping over here tonight,

00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:57.567
so I guess it might not
feel all that normal.

00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:02.614
I was on my way to the editing room…

00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.240
Mm-hmm.

00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:06.117
…and I just stopped by to see you.

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:08.661
I'll head out, then.

00:38:09.162 --> 00:38:10.455
Okay, bye.

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.457
- Bye?
- Yeah.

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.375
Okay, bye.

00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:16.753
We'll see you out from here.

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:19.464
See you after you're done. Bye!

00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:29.641
- Seriously!
- Come on!

00:38:29.724 --> 00:38:31.017
Your acting is so terrible!

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.936
- Your acting is way worse!
- Mine?

00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:34.896
Yeah! You could've blown it!

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.105
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

00:38:36.189 --> 00:38:37.899
- Just turn this off.
- Wait, no. Sorry.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.526
- Don't do it.
- I take it back. I'm sorry.

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:52.580
This place makes me so sleepy.

00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:55.416
It's too cramped. Sleep down there.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.961
Come on. It's not cramped!

00:38:58.044 --> 00:39:00.213
You seemed fine lying next to Mr. Lee.

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.508
- How did you…
- What do you think?

00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:07.220
I was just fishing and you took the bait.

00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:10.557
You're such an amateur.

00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:16.020
When are you going back to work, huh?

00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:18.064
I don't know.

00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:20.650
I just started my break, come on.

00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:22.861
Will you get married someday?

00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:25.071
Shouldn't you ask if I'm dating first?

00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:26.406
Hmm.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.410
You said you'll get promoted
and work some more

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.663
then move out of your mom's, right?

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.039
Probably.

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:39.210
What will you do when your eyes go bad
and you can't look at a computer anymore?

00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:41.254
Maybe I'll try farming.

00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:44.173
Will you have kids?

00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:45.425
Oh, please.

00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:47.760
Stop talking and go to sleep.

00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:49.804
Your eyes are way too bubbly.

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.516
You never know
what life will throw at you.

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.853
You'll have a fun life, right?

00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:59.772
I don't know.

00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:03.818
I'm sleepy. Let me sleep.

00:40:14.704 --> 00:40:15.705
I'm sorry…

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:20.877
I won't get to see it all.

00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:26.007
I'm sorry…

00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:31.220
I won't be here for that.

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.512
Spring is here.

00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:16.474
I see that.

00:41:17.725 --> 00:41:20.103
We saw the first snow together,

00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:21.813
and now the first cherry blossoms.

00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.608
- Should we go out for a proper look?
- Yeah.

00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:38.913
Want me to pick one for you?

00:41:39.706 --> 00:41:41.332
Mommy, pick a flower for me.

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.626
No, sweetie.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.337
These flowers are precious lives too.

00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:48.798
We can't just pick them, okay?

00:41:48.881 --> 00:41:49.882
Okay!

00:41:51.718 --> 00:41:53.052
You can't.

00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:57.140
I'll just take the thought.

00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:20.997
THANK YOU, DAEUM!
ROOTING FOR YOU

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.790
Thank you for letting me

00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:26.461
be more than just a patient
and for letting me live

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:29.505
as someone who makes movies
and falls in love.

00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:35.178
Thank you for making a movie with me
and loving me.

00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:37.764
Mr. Lee.

00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:39.474
Yes?

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:44.228
Are you as happy as you set out to be?

00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:47.148
I'm feeling even happier than I ever

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.567
set out to be.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.944
Me too.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.238
Me too, thanks to you.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.950
Gosh.

00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:06.250
I'm tired.

00:43:06.334 --> 00:43:07.710
I might fall asleep.

00:43:08.878 --> 00:43:10.755
But the weather is so nice outside.

00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:14.801
It's been cloudy for so long.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.099
Then I'll hang on a bit more.

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:24.811
It'd be a waste to just lie here
when the breeze is so nice.

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:45.623
OUR MOVIE

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:03.224
MY FAMILY, DAD,
DR. KIM, I LOVE YOU

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:29.959
MR. BU SEUNGWON,

00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:46.475
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR MS. YU HONG,
ALWAYS THE BUSIEST…

00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:05.036
THE DANDY DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
MR. JI AND BEAUTIFUL MS. JO!

00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.793
Oh. Oh.

00:45:12.877 --> 00:45:13.878
I'm sorry.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:23.387
AT ANDONG: MS. GO AND SEOYOUNG
WHO ALWAYS CARE FOR ME

00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:24.764
It's interesting.

00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:25.890
- Is it?
- Yeah.

00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:28.684
I knew you had a good eye for scripts.

00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:30.394
Gosh.

00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:43.032
MY SUPER FAN, MANAGER JUNBYUNG

00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:45.117
YOU'RE ALL I SEE

00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:05.346
AUNTIE, LIKE A MOM TO ME
MY FRIEND AND SISTER, GYOYEONG

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:08.349
Mom! I'm here.

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:15.648
I'm hungry.

00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:18.276
You shouldn't forget to eat.

00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:19.652
You can have a sandwich.

00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:20.903
- Can I?
- Yeah.

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.463
LOVE IN WHITE

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:42.925
LOVE IN WHITE
SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE

00:46:43.009 --> 00:46:46.887
THE LATE YU EUNAE

00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:56.647
Thank you, Mom.

00:47:24.592 --> 00:47:25.968
Like I took a sleeping pill.

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.264
I think we might be screwed.

00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:32.600
Don't lump me in.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.770
I'm fine. You're the one who's screwed.

00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:39.732
Really? You're bailing on me now?

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:42.443
You should take responsibility too.

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:43.611
I don't want to.

00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:45.613
Depends on what you do next.

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:53.454
Wow, that really hurts.

00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:58.667
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE
ADAPTED BY LEE JEHA, LEE DAEUM

00:48:00.753 --> 00:48:01.754
What?

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:04.799
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY BY YU EUNAE
ADAPTED BY LEE JEHA, LEE DAEUM

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.759
My name…

00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:07.843
is there.

00:48:07.927 --> 00:48:10.054
Did you forget? We wrote it together.

00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:12.723
"Adapted by Lee Daeum."

00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:16.394
No backing out now.

00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:19.688
I was going to sneak away,

00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:22.608
but so much for that. Darn it.

00:48:30.408 --> 00:48:31.409
<i>Hyunsang.</i>

00:48:32.368 --> 00:48:37.915
<i>I wanted to make sure you knew</i>
<i>that you could be happy again.</i>

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.878
<i>Live the time that is yours, Hyunsang.</i>

00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:46.465
<i>Live it fully and happily.</i>

00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:50.761
<i>I'll stay right here.</i>

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:53.639
- <i>In your heart…</i>
- Excuse me.

00:48:53.722 --> 00:48:55.391
<i>…and in this sea.</i>

00:49:06.402 --> 00:49:09.697
LOVE IN WHITE

00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:25.379
"I WANT TO FEEL REAL LOVE
BEFORE I DIE"

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.750
1 YEAR LATER

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:03.876
LIMCINE RESTAURANT

00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:05.961
So what if you know
lots of veteran actors?

00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:08.964
Do those veterans land you parts? Huh?

00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:12.927
The more connections you have,
the more chances you get, you know.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.387
Come on. You think I'm that clueless?

00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:18.224
Yeah, I think you're that clueless.

00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:20.392
What? Are you worried about me now?

00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:21.602
Me?

00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:23.771
Me?

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.147
Why would I worry about you?

00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:27.399
I've got enough to deal with on my own!

00:50:27.483 --> 00:50:28.859
You two aren't busy, right?

00:50:31.153 --> 00:50:33.364
Hang on. She may not be,

00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:35.783
but I'm a very busy woman. Here.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.743
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

00:50:38.494 --> 00:50:40.371
I've never even done this at home.

00:50:40.454 --> 00:50:42.414
Just do it if you have a shred of shame.

00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:45.251
You were practicing cheerleading like this

00:50:45.334 --> 00:50:47.711
for an audition,
and chugging booze like crazy.

00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:49.922
What? I never chugged booze…

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.304
Nothing is going right for me lately.

00:50:57.972 --> 00:50:59.765
Well, maybe try smiling more.

00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:03.477
That permanent frown isn't helping.

00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:06.480
It's not like smiling
ever brought me anything.

00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:08.107
"Smile, and luck will follow"?

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:10.776
I'll smile after luck comes, not before.

00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:12.027
I'd just look like a fool.

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:14.488
All right, now.

00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:17.783
Let's just start by smiling first.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.076
Copy me.

00:51:23.706 --> 00:51:24.999
Yeah, that's a bit better.

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:26.083
Second one.

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.129
Third one.

00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:35.175
That's not right!
You're mocking me, aren't you?

00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:36.844
Hey, that's it.

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.388
- Here you go. Thank you.
Oh, wow.

00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:41.765
They're so pretty.
Are they your daughters?

00:51:41.849 --> 00:51:42.975
They look alike, don't they?

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.643
They're my daughters.

00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:47.104
This one is Daeum. She's an actress.

00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:49.648
This one is Gyoyeong. She's a producer.

00:51:50.858 --> 00:51:53.319
- An actress?
- Yes. See right here.

00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:56.572
LOVE IN WHITE

00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:00.492
- Have you seen it?
- Yes.

00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:02.077
Isn't she a great actress?

00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:04.830
This one is a genre film.

00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:07.374
Gosh no. The title is weird.

00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:08.626
What's so weird about it?

00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:11.295
<i>The Unfinished Pursuit.</i>
What kind of title is that?

00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:13.714
So now the title has to please you too?

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:15.549
Of course. Titles are very important.

00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:17.885
Okay, okay. In this one,
you're the solo lead.

00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:21.555
You'd carry the whole movie by yourself.

00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:24.642
Hmm… Carrying a movie on my own…

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.394
is too lonely.

00:52:27.936 --> 00:52:29.063
It's no fun.

00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:30.189
All right.

00:52:30.773 --> 00:52:32.650
Then how about this? It has two leads.

00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:34.276
Not into it.

00:52:36.445 --> 00:52:39.239
Then what? What is it that you want to do?

00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:41.659
TOO FUNNY TO DO THIS
BY YU HONG

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.662
What the hell is with this title?

00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:46.705
Too funny to do what?

00:52:47.623 --> 00:52:50.084
Just read it. It's really interesting.

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:51.543
Come on.

00:52:52.544 --> 00:52:54.505
You're ignoring all these
top directors' scripts

00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:56.298
to choose… Yu Hong?

00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:57.716
- Yeah.
- Ms. Go.

00:52:58.717 --> 00:53:00.928
It's actually BUFILM's
most anticipated project.

00:53:01.512 --> 00:53:05.224
Man, I told that damn Mr. Bu
not to give you scripts directly.

00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:07.768
How much did we make
thanks to Mr. Bu last time?

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.688
Eight million people saw <i>Love in White</i>,
so if we calculate our share--

00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:13.399
Forget it. You're getting the lead, right?

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:15.526
I'll be the lead for this.

00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:17.528
THE EMPEROR

00:53:17.611 --> 00:53:19.154
That one is a cameo.

00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:22.950
I'll do one you want, and one I want.

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.577
Fair and square, everyone is happy.
Perfect, right?

00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:26.829
It's perfect.

00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:29.957
You should've told me sooner!

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.459
You think I wouldn't let you do a cameo?

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:34.545
Man, this is frustrating.

00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:39.174
You've got Chae Seoyoung
and you're wasting her on a cameo?

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:41.593
She offered to help big time, Director!

00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:44.888
What can I do? She doesn't fit the role.

00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:46.974
What is this?

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.268
Wait, I know this feeling.

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:52.396
I'm about to rant for 30 minutes

00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.189
and get all worked up alone,

00:53:54.273 --> 00:53:55.774
but you'll just end up

00:53:55.858 --> 00:53:57.484
casting that rookie as the lead.

00:53:57.568 --> 00:54:00.863
You picked up
all these weird habits from Jeha.

00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:04.324
You know, right?

00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:07.870
Why don't you just tell me now?

00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:11.123
Where's Jeha?

00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.958
And what's he up to?

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:17.212
Who knows? I have no idea.

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:18.922
Aren't you discharged soon?

00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:21.300
All right, I'm off.

00:54:21.383 --> 00:54:22.968
What? You're off again?

00:54:23.552 --> 00:54:25.637
- Well…
- You're going there, right?

00:54:27.222 --> 00:54:28.849
Take me with you sometime.

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.350
Take you where?

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:32.978
Keep up the good work, everyone.

00:54:39.735 --> 00:54:42.821
IN MEMORY OF KIM HYUNCHEOL…

00:54:42.905 --> 00:54:44.823
LOVE IN WHITE

00:54:48.827 --> 00:54:50.370
DIRECTED BY LEE DUYOUNG

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:52.498
WRITTEN BY YU EUNAE

00:54:56.752 --> 00:54:57.920
I'm here.

00:54:58.003 --> 00:54:59.129
Hey, you're here.

00:55:03.342 --> 00:55:06.220
How about this one today?

00:55:07.888 --> 00:55:09.014
I saw that last week.

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.226
With who?

00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:15.103
By myself, of course.

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.481
You don't watch movies alone.

00:55:18.065 --> 00:55:19.733
I can enjoy movies by myself now.

00:55:21.652 --> 00:55:23.820
You don't have to sit with me anymore.

00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:29.284
Let's watch one together just for today.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.521
Hey.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:59.606
You think you're all that? Well, so am I.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:02.192
And just like I've got dirt, so do you!
So what the hell?

00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:03.652
You think I did it on purpose?

00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:06.572
You think I hid you because I was ashamed?
I told you it's not that!

00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:08.532
You never mean any harm!

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:10.867
That's why I'm always
the only one going nuts!

00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:13.787
Don't go.

00:56:15.289 --> 00:56:16.373
Damn it.

00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:22.671
Cut. Let's try one more time.

00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:25.799
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.804
This movie is kind of insane.

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:31.972
<i>I can hear you, you know.</i>

00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:35.559
I mean,

00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:38.729
can't you help me discover
a new side of myself?

00:56:38.812 --> 00:56:40.355
I'm always the ex. Again.

00:56:40.439 --> 00:56:41.982
<i>That felt so real, Ms. Chae.</i>

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:45.235
I really thought you were his ex!

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.196
Right?

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.406
<i>You're the best.</i>

00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:52.284
Does she not know?

00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:54.036
I don't think she does.

00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:56.413
I said I can hear you.

00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:57.831
<i>What don't I know?</i>

00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:01.168
- F-stop 2.0.
- Okay.

00:57:17.017 --> 00:57:18.352
Long time no see.

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:20.437
What the heck? Seriously?

00:57:22.564 --> 00:57:23.690
Way too sweet.

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:26.693
You made me worry!

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:30.530
Mr. Lee.

00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:33.659
Well, look who it is. I don't know you.

00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:36.662
I knew it. You always act
like you won't show, then you do!

00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:38.497
You stole my actors, my crew…

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.083
You stole everything.
I didn't want to see that.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.627
Come on. Let's talk.

00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:45.754
Come on. Outside.

00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.215
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:49.341
Hello.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.762
Goodness.

00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.972
So, then. How have you been?

00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:58.517
Well, you know…

00:57:59.518 --> 00:58:02.104
Nothing out of the ordinary.

00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:04.439
Disappearing for a year is ordinary?

00:58:05.065 --> 00:58:06.149
You scared me, you bastard.

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:08.527
Thought you'd lock yourself up
for years again.

00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:10.195
I sent you an email.

00:58:11.279 --> 00:58:12.280
What email?

00:58:12.364 --> 00:58:14.658
What else would a director email about?

00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:16.368
A nice little hello?

00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:18.537
You've been writing?

00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:21.206
You've been writing all along?

00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:22.290
Yeah.

00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:24.209
I spent a year writing a script

00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:25.836
like an ordinary director.

00:58:27.796 --> 00:58:29.131
Answer my call next time.

00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:30.215
Okay.

00:58:36.888 --> 00:58:38.014
Have you been well?

00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:39.766
Yeah, I have.

00:58:41.727 --> 00:58:42.894
It looked pretty good.

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.021
Yeah.

00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:47.315
I missed this kind of vibe.

00:58:49.568 --> 00:58:51.319
You're not going to ask how I've been?

00:58:56.074 --> 00:58:57.451
I hoped you were okay.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.579
Yeah.

00:59:00.662 --> 00:59:02.372
Seoyoung!

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.960
Goodbye, Mr. Lee.

00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:09.129
Bye.

00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:49.961
Excuse me, sir.

00:59:50.545 --> 00:59:52.547
Could I borrow a dolly?

00:59:52.631 --> 00:59:53.965
Moving some stuff?

00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:56.802
- I'm moving out.
- What?

00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.889
<i>Ah! Could you check the garden?</i>
<i>I think it's there.</i>

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.651
<i>How did you know I lived here?</i>

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:15.403
<i>Your friend is my manager after all.</i>

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:19.825
Want to step outside?

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:21.660
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:31.920
<i>You're like a person</i>

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.381
<i>made of concrete.</i>

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:39.052
<i>You know what? It just feels too unfair.</i>

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:43.932
<i>Scene 30.</i>

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.894
<i>"The two share a soft kiss."</i>

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.076
Hey, babe.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.578
When are you coming?

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.162
I'm all alone in this empty house.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.207
It's not my fault. Jeha was late.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.211
Get over here already.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:15.297
Sorry we took so long.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.220
You said you'd never be a director,

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.514
but now you're making a huge debut.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:27.726
It's all thanks
to you and Daeum, of course.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.020
- How come?
- <i>Love in White</i>.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:33.982
At first, I just jumped in
because I was curious about you.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:36.192
I regretted it sometimes along the way.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:39.487
I so was sure
we wouldn't be able to finish it.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.781
Then what?

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.451
But then,

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.661
you gave everything up,

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:47.787
threw everything away,

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.875
just believed in each other,
and somehow finished the movie

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.502
that I thought was impossible to make.

01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:56.546
I questioned why people make movies,

01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.632
and I realized that was why.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.676
I wanted to make a movie like that
for once in my life.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.886
To go all in like that,

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:04.721
like Daeum did

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.973
and like you did.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.683
That's how I came to think.

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.644
Isn't she amazing?

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:11.853
That's why I like you.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.398
Now that you've tried it, how is it?

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:18.485
How is it?

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:20.278
I'm losing my mind.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:22.948
I absolutely love it!

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.376
- We're heading out now.
- Okay.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.503
You didn't have to help.
It was unnecessary.

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.796
<i>"Unnecessary"?</i>

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:39.756
I hate that word, "unnecessary."

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.758
Maybe it is, but we can still go together.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:45.595
Unnecessary, but…

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.472
thanks for helping out.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.560
Mr. Lee, I didn't come to work for free.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.938
Please come by the set more often.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.566
Before I forget, here you go.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.694
Gyoyeong sent you this.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.820
We're off.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:14.541
LOVE IN WHITE

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:48.408
- TO DIRECTOR LEE JEHA
- LEE DAEUM -

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.755
<i>Hi, Mr. Lee.</i>

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:04.632
<i>Uh…</i>

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.302
<i>I have something I want to say to you,</i>

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:09.929
<i>but I was worried</i>
<i>you might forget if I just said it,</i>

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:11.723
<i>so I'm using a camera and everything.</i>

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.518
<i>Mr. Lee.</i>

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.688
Everyone dies.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.399
It's not just me.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.987
<i>Just think of this as a little time apart.</i>

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:30.366
<i>Because we're meant</i>
<i>to see each other again.</i>

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.036
<i>But that time we spend apart,</i>

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:35.330
<i>as you've experienced before,</i>

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.831
<i>hurts so much.</i>

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.250
<i>The pain gets sharper every day</i>

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.336
<i>and you don't know when it'll end.</i>

01:04:41.419 --> 01:04:44.047
<i>We know very well what that's like.</i>

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.341
<i>Remember to eat well,</i>

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.968
<i>write some more awesome scripts…</i>

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:52.764
<i>…and make a really,</i>
<i>really great next movie.</i>

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:54.682
<i>Keep living well like that.</i>

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.101
And…

01:04:57.352 --> 01:05:00.688
when a day comes
where you miss me really badly…

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:04.317
…just think of me as much as you want.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.195
<i>Think about what a ridiculous person I was</i>

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:12.242
<i>and how passionate our love was.</i>

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.369
<i>Think of it over and over again.</i>

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.871
<i>I heard I'll be able to feel all that.</i>

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:18.540
<i>So…</i>

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.876
<i>grieve for me so much that it reaches me.</i>

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.505
<i>I'll also be well,</i>

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:29.592
<i>uh, and whenever I feel your emotions,</i>

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:31.761
<i>I'll think of you then.</i>

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:35.014
<i>And when I do, you'll feel me too.</i>

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:38.017
<i>All right.</i>

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.103
<i>Here's my final gift.</i>

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:42.438
<i>Enjoy this beautiful face.</i>

01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:58.538
<i>I love you.</i>

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.750
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.134
I do too.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.012
I love you too.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.698
Am I really
in love with this woman?

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.326
Honestly, I'm not so sure.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.330
It kind of feels like
I just got caught up in the moment.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:44.083
Feels like there should be
a clear starting point, you know?

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.175
EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY KNOWS.
THAT IT'S LOVE.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:54.928
What's with this sappy melodrama?

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.430
It came to me
while I was reading the script.

01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:01.184
Gyuwon and Hyunsang
wouldn't just kiss on a whim.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.103
Gyuwon wants him to know.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.982
<i>"Look. Don't you feel it too?"</i>

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.860
<i>"It's already begun."</i>

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:17.784
Mr. Lee?

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.540
Love doesn't always
have to start with certainty.

01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:26.251
Then what does it start with?

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.504
When you're in love…

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.176
every cell in your body knows it.
That it's love.

01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.097
Well, that's…

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:41.975
a good point.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:45.311
Just relax and try it.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.563
We can talk through it again afterward.

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:49.691
Okay.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.324
THE RETURN
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY LEE JEHA

01:08:02.954 --> 01:08:05.123
- The heck?
- Oh, no. The equipment.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.207
This way.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:14.716
Here comes another bump, huh?

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:17.176
I knew things were going
a little too smoothly.

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:20.013
Should we wrap up for the day?

01:08:21.306 --> 01:08:23.057
No, let's keep going like this.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:25.310
Okay.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.023

00:16:12.393 --> 00:16:13.849
Not just one,

00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:16.833
but three brothers have not married yet.

00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:27.319
I hear you can find your
match at Dahong Club.

00:16:27.343 --> 00:16:28.943
Dahong Club?

00:16:29.813 --> 00:16:32.743
The noble ladies' club, you know.

00:16:33.963 --> 00:16:35.299
<i>I think I read about it in the book.</i>

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:36.703
[The Obsessive Tyrant]

00:16:38.393 --> 00:16:40.549
[Dahong Club is a social club
of noblemen's daughters]

00:16:40.573 --> 00:16:42.619
The club that meets on
the 15th of every month?

00:16:42.643 --> 00:16:46.049
The meeting happens tonight.

00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:49.499
You need to start getting ready now.

00:16:49.523 --> 00:16:50.809
Ready how?

00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:52.429
Do you not remember?

00:16:52.453 --> 00:16:55.749
You told me we had to prepare for it.

00:16:55.773 --> 00:16:59.303
Anyway, we need to start getting ready now.

00:17:07.923 --> 00:17:09.679
My Sun Chaek.

00:17:09.703 --> 00:17:14.269
You are representing
the Cha family of Yeonan.

00:17:14.293 --> 00:17:17.643
Make sure you look the best in Hanyang.

00:17:19.213 --> 00:17:20.529
Do not skimp.

00:17:20.553 --> 00:17:22.679
Make sure to spend all of it.

00:17:22.703 --> 00:17:26.033
It is your father's order.

00:17:30.323 --> 00:17:33.003
If that is your order,

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.599
I should follow it, Father.

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:38.903
Yes.

00:17:50.203 --> 00:17:53.783
<i>Someone gets me dolled up,</i>

00:17:54.883 --> 00:17:57.103
<i>dresses me,</i>

00:18:09.953 --> 00:18:12.163
<i>and makes me shine.</i>

00:18:13.073 --> 00:18:15.219
<i>This is the life of a side character?</i>

00:18:15.243 --> 00:18:17.183
<i>Daebak.</i>

00:18:18.883 --> 00:18:22.143
I can't believe I'm in a fictional world.

00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:29.843
What happens if I can't get out of here?

00:18:32.263 --> 00:18:34.729
I'd be grateful, then.

00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:37.413
Why would I leave this world?

00:18:45.663 --> 00:18:48.663
The smell of money is always so fragrant.

00:18:56.353 --> 00:19:00.769
And I'm in my favorite novel?

00:19:00.793 --> 00:19:04.229
This is better than winning the lottery.

00:19:04.253 --> 00:19:08.503
I'm in the novel. Hooray!

00:19:14.943 --> 00:19:19.349
What father scolds you
for not spending money?

00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:23.219
It's nice to be the Chief State
Minister's daughter.

00:19:23.243 --> 00:19:25.799
So, what if I'm in someone else's body?

00:19:25.823 --> 00:19:29.103
This is a dream, but I won't wake up.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:40.169
Dahong Club and the full moon are tonight.

00:19:40.193 --> 00:19:42.429
I'm still at the beginning of the book.

00:19:42.453 --> 00:19:45.909
It's when the characters
start crossing paths.

00:19:45.933 --> 00:19:47.453
My Lady.

00:19:48.403 --> 00:19:51.203
- This way.
- Oh, okay.

00:20:17.103 --> 00:20:19.303
You came, Lady Sun Chaek.

00:20:19.353 --> 00:20:21.059
Welcome, My Lady.

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:22.533
Yes.

00:20:36.393 --> 00:20:38.159
My Lady.

00:20:38.183 --> 00:20:40.529
Look at these colors.

00:20:40.553 --> 00:20:44.273
They must be angel's clothes.

00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:47.289
Is this better?

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:49.439
Or is this better?

00:20:49.463 --> 00:20:51.803
I like both.

00:20:52.803 --> 00:20:56.259
The clothes I'm wearing
are made of silk, too.

00:20:56.283 --> 00:20:59.789
Since you like pure silk...

00:20:59.813 --> 00:21:02.779
Pure silk?

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.719
Silk made of pure silk yarn.

00:21:05.743 --> 00:21:07.639
Because you kept talking about it,

00:21:07.663 --> 00:21:11.589
they got it all the way
from China in three months.

00:21:11.613 --> 00:21:14.449
Did I do that?

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:17.353
Should we go with this, then?

00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:20.609
Since you only wear top-quality clothes,

00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:22.999
you have exceptional taste.

00:21:23.023 --> 00:21:24.279
My Lady,

00:21:24.303 --> 00:21:27.159
since His Excellency
gave us plenty of money,

00:21:27.183 --> 00:21:29.729
how about we get both?

00:21:29.753 --> 00:21:31.189
Should we?

00:21:31.213 --> 00:21:35.859
No one else can buy these but you.

00:21:35.883 --> 00:21:37.743
Hold on a moment.

00:21:50.523 --> 00:21:54.819
I think that dress will look better on me.

00:21:54.843 --> 00:21:57.503
Let me have it this time.

00:21:58.493 --> 00:22:00.689
You came, Lady Hwa Seon.

00:22:00.713 --> 00:22:02.273
<i>Hwa Seon?</i>

00:22:03.163 --> 00:22:05.313
<i>Do Hwa Seon, by chance?</i>

00:22:07.363 --> 00:22:11.529
<i>Do Hwa Seon, the Right State
Minister's third daughter.</i>

00:22:11.553 --> 00:22:15.009
<i>As her name implies, she starts
all conflicts and incidents.</i>

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.713
<i>She's wicked.</i>

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:22.849
I heard someone ordered a summer
garment made from this silk.

00:22:22.873 --> 00:22:25.709
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong did.

00:22:25.733 --> 00:22:28.673
I should wear this dress, then.

00:22:28.703 --> 00:22:33.659
We would look like a beautiful couple.

00:22:33.683 --> 00:22:37.969
But Sun Cheok ordered this first.

00:22:37.993 --> 00:22:39.569
A-Are you okay?

00:22:39.593 --> 00:22:42.703
How dare a lowly man
jump into our conversation?

00:22:44.343 --> 00:22:46.459
M-My apologies.

00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:47.769
Lady,

00:22:47.793 --> 00:22:50.709
they act up if you treat them nicely.

00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:52.809
Make them learn their place.

00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:54.989
<i>Seeing her in person like this</i>

00:22:55.013 --> 00:22:57.119
<i>is even more infuriating.</i>

00:22:57.143 --> 00:23:01.353
Do you want to tell me
something, by chance?

00:23:02.743 --> 00:23:03.809
My Lady.

00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:05.483
Excuse me,

00:23:07.843 --> 00:23:09.713
those clothes...

00:23:11.863 --> 00:23:14.969
- Hwa Seon, you-
- Hwa Seon?

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:18.299
Lady Hwa Seon, you can

00:23:18.323 --> 00:23:20.733
just have it.

00:23:24.203 --> 00:23:27.659
You are the Chief
State Minister's daughter.

00:23:27.683 --> 00:23:30.319
Assert dominance.

00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:33.189
<i>Main skills. Arson and kidnapping.</i>

00:23:33.213 --> 00:23:35.679
<i>Mastered poisoning and
murdering as a hobby.</i>

00:23:35.703 --> 00:23:37.869
<i>Getting involved with a notorious villain</i>

00:23:37.893 --> 00:23:39.899
<i>would make my life tiring.</i>

00:23:39.923 --> 00:23:42.709
Do you mean it?

00:23:42.733 --> 00:23:44.529
- Of course.
- My Lady.

00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:45.969
What has gotten into you?

00:23:45.993 --> 00:23:49.249
You always get top-quality silk.

00:23:49.273 --> 00:23:51.209
But you are letting me have this?

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:53.169
I wonder if you are plotting something.

00:23:53.193 --> 00:23:55.489
I am so scared.

00:23:55.513 --> 00:23:58.679
<i>I find you scarier.</i>

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:03.119
<i>Please take those clothes and leave.</i>

00:24:03.143 --> 00:24:06.819
If you matched with Prince Gyeongseong,

00:24:06.843 --> 00:24:11.399
you would look so beautiful as a couple.

00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:15.539
Of course, I should let you have it.

00:24:15.563 --> 00:24:17.849
If you insist,

00:24:17.873 --> 00:24:19.439
I will not say no.

00:24:19.463 --> 00:24:21.569
I will leave now, then.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:23.383
Hold on.

00:24:24.283 --> 00:24:26.413
What is it now?

00:24:27.403 --> 00:24:29.229
Since you let me have the clothes,

00:24:29.253 --> 00:24:32.099
I would like to treat you to a tea.

00:24:32.123 --> 00:24:35.909
You will not reject my kind offer, will you?

00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:38.843
I am not rejecting it.

00:24:39.773 --> 00:24:41.393
Okay.

00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:45.439
Send the dress to our house.

00:24:45.463 --> 00:24:47.089
Okay, got it.

00:24:47.113 --> 00:24:48.733
Let us go.

00:25:25.353 --> 00:25:27.133
My Lady,

00:25:28.743 --> 00:25:33.643
thank you for letting us host
a Dahong Club meeting tonight.

00:25:35.323 --> 00:25:38.243
I am a bit busy.

00:25:56.473 --> 00:25:58.779
Acting all pitiful...

00:25:58.803 --> 00:26:01.889
Let us drink tea next
time since I am upset.

00:26:01.913 --> 00:26:04.833
Who is she, by the way?

00:26:05.963 --> 00:26:07.339
Do you dislike her?

00:26:07.363 --> 00:26:10.719
Yes, I do. Very much.

00:26:10.743 --> 00:26:12.739
She is a depressing orphan.

00:26:12.763 --> 00:26:14.579
How dare she try to join the Dahong Club?

00:26:14.603 --> 00:26:16.619
Even her name sounds fake.

00:26:16.643 --> 00:26:18.929
It's Cho Eun Ae♪ or whatever.
(Means, "good kid")

00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:21.129
Cho Eun Ae?

00:26:21.153 --> 00:26:22.799
She was born as an orphan

00:26:22.823 --> 00:26:25.609
and adopted by the wealthiest merchant
in Joseon by coincidence.

00:26:25.633 --> 00:26:28.199
<i>Serendipitously, she falls in love
with Prince Gyeongseong,</i>

00:26:28.223 --> 00:26:31.443
<i>Yi Beon, regardless
of the class difference.</i>

00:26:32.973 --> 00:26:36.869
<i>I get to see my favorite,
Eun Ae, in person.</i>

00:26:36.893 --> 00:26:39.389
Let us work together,

00:26:39.413 --> 00:26:42.709
and make sure she cannot come near here.

00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:44.849
Let us teach her a lesson

00:26:44.873 --> 00:26:47.199
tonight.

00:26:47.223 --> 00:26:48.579
Tonight?

00:26:48.603 --> 00:26:51.789
The tea house owned by
her father, Cho Byeong Mo,

00:26:51.813 --> 00:26:54.769
will be in charge of the hosting
of the Dahong Club.

00:26:54.793 --> 00:26:57.049
They are using money
to mingle with the nobility.

00:26:57.073 --> 00:27:00.303
I am planning to discipline her properly.

00:27:02.023 --> 00:27:03.509
Do you agree with me,

00:27:03.533 --> 00:27:05.723
Lady Sun Chaek?

00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:21.335
Gosh, look at this.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:23.885
Are your brothers doing well?

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:25.925
- Thank you.
- I hope this is enough.

00:27:25.949 --> 00:27:27.889
Thank you.

00:27:28.969 --> 00:27:31.585
Now that I've met her, I get why.

00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:34.259
Eun Ae is the female lead.

00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:38.045
She's been through
endless hardship since birth,

00:27:38.069 --> 00:27:40.475
but endless coincidences
and destined timing

00:27:40.499 --> 00:27:42.569
that turn crises into opportunities.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:46.485
She even has a devastating quality

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:49.359
that draws people in.

00:27:50.439 --> 00:27:53.739
She's the perfect female lead.

00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:59.799
On the other hand, Cha Sun Chaek

00:28:02.709 --> 00:28:05.405
has a high status, endless money,

00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:07.035
and a happy family.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:10.135
She's not lacking in any sense.

00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:12.659
The observer with a privilege.

00:28:13.629 --> 00:28:18.895
I just need to observe
this fun story, right?

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:21.449
This is amazing.

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:25.965
What's this?

00:28:25.989 --> 00:28:28.239
I feel something.

00:28:38.949 --> 00:28:40.919
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:56.189
I knew it. It's Yi Beon,
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:03.989
He's way more handsome than I thought.

00:29:21.189 --> 00:29:24.929
<i>Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong...</i>

00:29:39.339 --> 00:29:41.405
<i>He volunteered to be the
hunting dog of the royal family.</i>

00:29:41.429 --> 00:29:43.109
<i>He's a monster.</i>

00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:50.305
<i>He shows no blood or tear.</i>

00:29:50.329 --> 00:29:53.569
<i>He's the male lead of this world.</i>

00:29:59.669 --> 00:30:01.885
Why can I not raise my head?

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:03.585
If you make eye contact
with Prince Gyeongseong,

00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:05.915
something terrible might happen to you.

00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:07.725
During the royal banquet,

00:30:07.749 --> 00:30:10.065
<i>a hair was found in his food.</i>

00:30:10.089 --> 00:30:11.775
We deserve to die!

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:14.065
<i>We deserve to die!</i>

00:30:14.089 --> 00:30:15.895
<i>He apparently cut all the hair off</i>

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:18.599
<i>the kitchen staff's heads.</i>

00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:22.135
A servant scratched his hand slightly
while dressing him up.

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:24.465
Your Highness!

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:27.699
Spare me. Spare me...

00:30:35.329 --> 00:30:38.335
<i>He pulled out her fingernails and toenails.</i>

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:41.385
Someone who got caught chatting
during the rainmaking ceremony

00:30:41.409 --> 00:30:44.719
got all of their teeth pulled out.

00:30:49.369 --> 00:30:51.235
That is not all.

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:52.935
The women who spent a night with him

00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:55.425
were forced to become
Buddhist nuns the day after.

00:30:55.449 --> 00:30:58.575
So, they had to join the temple by force.

00:30:58.599 --> 00:31:01.009
There is no need to fear.

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:10.439
Here.

00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:15.155
It is best to believe what you see
rather than listen to rumors.

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:17.349
Who are you?

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.945
<i>The supporting male character,
the official of Hongmungwan.</i>

00:31:22.969 --> 00:31:24.615
<i>Jung Su Gyeom.</i>

00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:26.415
<i>He's sweet, proper,</i>

00:31:26.439 --> 00:31:28.015
<i>and he's even intelligent.</i>

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:30.505
<i>He's the prime example
of a supporting character,</i>

00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:33.599
<i>and the only friend of Yi Beon,
Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:37.229
Look, Beon. Wait for me.

00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:46.485
Beon,

00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:49.069
did you find out who that man was?

00:31:52.009 --> 00:31:55.559
Your face tells me you have not caught him.

00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:00.169
I can tell by just looking at your eyes.

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:04.725
I told you not to call me that.

00:32:04.749 --> 00:32:07.595
Come on, Beon. My Beon.

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:10.095
It is just between us.

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:12.939
I think I.

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:00.469
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:09.155
The love quadrangle is even
more intense in person.

00:33:09.179 --> 00:33:11.595
If tonight is the full moon,

00:33:11.619 --> 00:33:13.885
Eun Ae and Yi Beon's encounter

00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:16.579
has not happened yet.

00:33:17.699 --> 00:33:21.435
Do I just need to wait
for the highlight of the night?

00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:23.155
Where can I get popcorn?

00:33:23.179 --> 00:33:25.219
Explosion!

00:33:46.889 --> 00:33:49.505
This is the best spot to watch.

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:54.409
A masterpiece is still fun,
even when you know the ending.

00:34:08.899 --> 00:34:10.545
Move!

00:34:10.569 --> 00:34:13.505
- Move!
- Move!

00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:15.255
Passing by. Move.

00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:17.345
- Move!
- Move!

00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:21.555
Gosh, I can't believe I'm going
to a Dahong Club meeting.

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:24.279
It's too exciting.

00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:27.025
No.

00:34:27.049 --> 00:34:28.955
It's exciting and nerve-wracking,

00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:31.505
but I can't show it.

00:34:31.529 --> 00:34:34.905
In this type of genre, a side character

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:38.369
can get wrongly involved
and twist the story.

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:44.629
Know your place for everyone's sake.

00:34:45.539 --> 00:34:47.239
Know your place.

00:35:22.529 --> 00:35:24.989
- Cook it all the way.
- Yes, My Lady.

00:35:35.179 --> 00:35:37.325
Nothing can be lacking.

00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:40.495
We need to prepare with
a lot more care than usual.

00:35:40.519 --> 00:35:42.405
<i>Yes, My Lady.</i>

00:35:42.429 --> 00:35:44.009
Yes, My Lady.

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:50.519
Gosh, no way.

00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:54.005
It reminds me of your eyes.

00:35:54.029 --> 00:35:56.389
So pretty.

00:35:57.299 --> 00:35:58.655
Lady Hwa Seon,

00:35:58.679 --> 00:36:01.805
I cannot look at you tonight.

00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:05.009
You are too radiant tonight.

00:36:06.779 --> 00:36:08.595
I know.

00:36:08.619 --> 00:36:11.075
Lady Hwa Seon sure is

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:14.109
the greatest beauty of Hanyang.

00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:18.815
Do you not agree?

00:36:18.839 --> 00:36:22.265
Oh, yes. You are right.

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:26.009
She is like a dragonfly.

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:32.405
I mean, she is like an angel from heaven.

00:36:32.429 --> 00:36:35.205
Angel! Angel.

00:36:35.229 --> 00:36:37.445
<i>Blindly agreeing with others</i>

00:36:37.469 --> 00:36:40.045
<i>is a side character's job.</i>

00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:42.285
Everyone,

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:44.899
the tea and snacks are ready.

00:36:53.299 --> 00:36:56.915
This is a work of art.

00:36:56.939 --> 00:36:59.025
Gosh, so beautiful.

00:36:59.049 --> 00:37:00.745
So beautiful.

00:37:00.769 --> 00:37:04.199
We can each take a plate.

00:37:12.179 --> 00:37:13.985
My Lady,

00:37:14.009 --> 00:37:15.999
have a cup of tea.

00:37:30.029 --> 00:37:31.969
Would you pour it for me?

00:37:35.799 --> 00:37:37.879
Of course, My Lady.

00:37:49.949 --> 00:37:51.115
Was my hand slippery?

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:52.475
Are you okay, My Lady?

00:37:52.499 --> 00:37:53.885
I feel so terrible.

00:37:53.909 --> 00:37:55.495
The floor got so dirty.

00:37:55.519 --> 00:37:57.769
I will clean it.

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:05.725
Could you clean quickly?

00:38:05.749 --> 00:38:07.675
I am a bit sensitive.

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:09.589
Yes, My Lady.

00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:25.905
I will come back in a bit.

00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:27.909
My apologies.

00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:35.999
Take this.

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:39.589
Thank you.

00:38:43.649 --> 00:38:46.575
<i>Eun Ae, cheer up.</i>

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:49.205
<i>You'll win everything eventually.</i>

00:38:49.229 --> 00:38:51.815
<i>You'll meet the male
lead and be happy, too.</i>

00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:53.855
<i>Because you're the main
character of this novel.</i>

00:38:53.879 --> 00:38:55.449
<i>Fighting.</i>

00:39:10.769 --> 00:39:12.975
Why would you give a
handkerchief to a servant?

00:39:12.999 --> 00:39:16.295
Was I not aware that
you are friends with her?

00:39:16.319 --> 00:39:20.695
I just cannot stand blood.

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:24.055
My father raised me, making sure

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:26.695
I do not see anything horrific.

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:29.805
You must all know, do you not?

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:32.145
My father, the Chief State Minister,

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:36.209
His Excellency Cha Ho Yeol.

00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:42.095
She is making a fuss over a little cut.

00:39:42.119 --> 00:39:44.195
She must have acted pitiful
in front of Cho Byeong Mo

00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:46.465
and got herself adopted.

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:48.435
Actually,

00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:49.815
she is supposedly his daughter,

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:52.615
but she frequents his bedroom, apparently.

00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:55.175
- Gosh, really?
- Yes.

00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:59.195
She is so unexpectedly devious.

00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:03.639
They say the tame cat
reaches the roof first.

00:40:04.549 --> 00:40:07.275
<i>What awful gossip.</i>

00:40:07.299 --> 00:40:09.595
<i>Should I step in?</i>

00:40:09.619 --> 00:40:11.285
<i>No.</i>

00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:14.325
<i>Don't step in. You'll only give
yourself a headache.</i>

00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:18.105
She looks innocent, but she is scary.

00:40:18.129 --> 00:40:21.949
<i>I did not think she would be so obnoxious.</i>

00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:26.139
<i>I know. I know.</i>

00:40:33.539 --> 00:40:35.115
According to a report,

00:40:35.139 --> 00:40:37.015
they're hiding in this alley.

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:39.665
They apparently meet up

00:40:39.689 --> 00:40:41.375
at this place often.

00:40:41.399 --> 00:40:44.665
They do not even hide. How proud.

00:40:44.689 --> 00:40:46.685
As if they have multiple lives.

00:40:46.709 --> 00:40:49.855
They seem incredibly gutsy.

00:40:49.879 --> 00:40:53.529
I wonder if someone is helping them.

00:40:55.549 --> 00:41:00.649
We can finally catch
the Heuksa Clan, right?

00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:23.699
What?

00:41:26.749 --> 00:41:28.595
It is not that, My Lady.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.205
I did not want to believe the rumor,

00:41:30.229 --> 00:41:33.305
but you really are devious.

00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:35.075
If I scold you,

00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:39.559
people would say I bully you for no reason.

00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:44.195
That is not true. You are mistaken.

00:41:44.219 --> 00:41:46.635
Mistaken? I am glad you said that.

00:41:46.659 --> 00:41:51.305
Let us resolve the misunderstanding now.

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:53.485
- Pardon?
- I heard you and your father

00:41:53.509 --> 00:41:55.195
have an inappropriate relationship.

00:41:55.219 --> 00:41:57.865
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

00:41:57.889 --> 00:41:59.375
I heard you frequent his bedroom

00:41:59.399 --> 00:42:01.955
and serve him by his bed.

00:42:01.979 --> 00:42:04.875
<i>You cannot mess with her family.</i>

00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:07.685
<i>She really is crazy.</i>

00:42:07.709 --> 00:42:10.819
I do not mind you disgracing me,

00:42:11.939 --> 00:42:14.335
but please do not disgrace my father.

00:42:14.359 --> 00:42:16.335
My father saved and raised me

00:42:16.359 --> 00:42:18.999
when I had nowhere to go.

00:42:19.909 --> 00:42:21.005
I did not say anything.

00:42:21.029 --> 00:42:22.745
I know.

00:42:22.769 --> 00:42:28.705
I am just curious if Cho Byeong Mo
is your father or husband.

00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:30.745
<i>No, hold back.</i>

00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:32.215
<i>Don't get involved.</i>

00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:33.555
<i>Stay put.</i>

00:42:33.579 --> 00:42:35.045
<i>Stay put, I said.</i>

00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:37.129
Are you in pain?

00:42:38.919 --> 00:42:41.179
Stop!

00:43:44.379 --> 00:43:47.269
I will not go easy on you because
you are Prince Gyeongseong.

00:44:44.299 --> 00:44:46.349
Who are you working for?

00:44:59.889 --> 00:45:01.525
Stop, stop...

00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:03.539
Stop, stop...

00:45:04.389 --> 00:45:07.949
Stop! Spare me! Spare me...

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:14.275
If you spare me,

00:45:14.299 --> 00:45:16.865
I can make you the king.

00:45:16.889 --> 00:45:21.345
You don't want to be the royal
family's hunting dog forever.

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:23.969
I am not interested in the throne.

00:45:58.579 --> 00:46:01.309
Aigoo, here you go.

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:23.041
There is something I want to say.

00:46:23.065 --> 00:46:25.461
What do you want to say?

00:46:25.485 --> 00:46:28.445
So, what I want to say is...

00:46:35.285 --> 00:46:38.721
The full moon is so beautiful tonight.

00:46:38.745 --> 00:46:41.835
How about we all drink together?

00:46:43.175 --> 00:46:45.551
Drink together?

00:46:45.575 --> 00:46:46.751
Yes.

00:46:46.775 --> 00:46:49.631
But I do not mean tea.

00:46:49.655 --> 00:46:51.391
I mean alcohol.

00:46:51.415 --> 00:46:52.491
All of a sudden?

00:46:52.515 --> 00:46:55.601
Let us be honest. Why drink tea at night?

00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:57.361
It will keep us up at night.

00:46:57.385 --> 00:47:01.175
Sir Cho Byeong Mo's
daughter is a bit unhip.

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:06.471
I mean, she is a bit clueless.

00:47:06.495 --> 00:47:09.051
Alcohol is appropriate at night.

00:47:09.075 --> 00:47:11.561
You need to drink when the full moon is up.

00:47:11.585 --> 00:47:14.495
Would that not be romantic?

00:47:17.155 --> 00:47:19.121
Instead of meeting at a tea house,

00:47:19.145 --> 00:47:22.725
should we not meet at
a tavern on a night like this?

00:47:27.045 --> 00:47:31.435
I noticed it at the garment
shop, but you are

00:47:34.965 --> 00:47:37.131
very much in sync with me.

00:47:37.155 --> 00:47:39.075
Right?

00:47:42.065 --> 00:47:44.165
Let us drink.

Let us.

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:53.131
I hear Cho Byeong Mo is

00:47:53.155 --> 00:47:56.191
hiding a liquor even the King cannot get.

00:47:56.215 --> 00:47:59.415
Bring us the best kind.

00:48:01.435 --> 00:48:02.905
Yes.

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.785

What are you doing?

00:49:06.455 --> 00:49:10.291
I wanted you to try something new.

Something new?

They don't have beer here.

What are you mumbling to yourself?

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.191
It is nothing.

00:49:23.215 --> 00:49:28.361
Everyone, have you heard of a cocktail?

00:49:28.385 --> 00:49:30.725
<i>Cocktail?</i>

00:49:53.415 --> 00:49:56.481
This is Bokgeolju.

00:49:56.505 --> 00:50:00.085
I mixed bokbunja and makgeolli.

00:50:01.115 --> 00:50:05.335
I've never made a cocktail
using bokbunja wine.

00:50:10.475 --> 00:50:14.031
My gosh. It's tangy but smooth.

I have never tasted anything like it.

She is the Chief State Minister's
daughter. She cannot tell a lie.

Here. This is the full moon drink.

00:50:29.135 --> 00:50:32.921
I made it just for Lady Hwa Seon.

00:50:32.945 --> 00:50:34.691
Full moon drink?

00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:36.591
Drink the full moon inside of it.

00:50:36.615 --> 00:50:40.995
You'll experience a brand-new sensation.

00:50:43.025 --> 00:50:45.381
Here's to your eyes.

I'll reveal the golden ratios.

00:51:18.145 --> 00:51:21.485
Okay, step in line.

00:51:28.045 --> 00:51:30.401
I am the Right State Minister's daughter.

Is something going on here?

00:52:37.395 --> 00:52:40.041
and the drinks taste amazing, apparently.

What kind of drinks are they?

00:52:42.675 --> 00:52:44.691
What did she say?

00:52:44.715 --> 00:52:46.681

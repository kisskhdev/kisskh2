(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.360
Mother.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.719
There are so many things
I wish I could tell you.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.039
Yet,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.479
you can no longer hear me.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.639
Your Highness.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.120
Mr. Qingya sent a gift.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.750
An offering for the Imperial Consort.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.360
This is a painting
done by Mother herself.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.800
But...

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.759
How could he have it?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.039
Your Highness,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.319
after today's ceremony, I overheard people
in the palace talking.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.850
They said that when the Imperial Consort
was gravely ill, she was not unattended.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.080
What?

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.240
They said

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.800
someone visited her many times.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.080
But that person wore a mask,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.280
so no one saw the face clearly.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.280
If you ask me,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.080
it must have been Mr. Qingya.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.280
Your Highness,

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.960
perhaps you could

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.439
ask him yourself.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.990
Maybe things are not
as bleak as they seem.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.919
The Imperial Consort
had old acquaintances in the capital,

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.599
who arranged
for her belongings long ago.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.159
It is comforting to hear,
and I thank you.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.500
(Qingya and White Deer)

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.959
Xing.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.000
Go to the Lotus Pavilion.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.639
Tell them,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.319
Xiao Pingning awaits at the residence

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.480
and invites Mr. Qingya for a meeting.

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:29.560
Understood.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.680
You came.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.439
Thank you.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.439
Thank me for what?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360
Thank you, Mr. Qingya,

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.079
for helping me once again.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.680
Good liquor.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800
Naturally.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:46.879
This is Daughter's Red
brewed by my mother herself,

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:49.199
(Year after year, we shared the spring breeze)
prepared especially

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.399
for my wedding day.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:53.560
But…

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.360
When she brewed it, she told me

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.720
the sealing labels
of this wine were meaningful.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.959
She said I must ask them
from someone I cherish.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.079
She insisted I
seek out a certain person.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.040
Looking back now,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.639
all those thoughts in my heart…

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.439
Mother was the first person
who truly saw through me.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:34.580
(Year after year,
we share the spring breeze.)

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:48.560
Why does Your Highness need so many

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.279
wine labels?

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:52.759
I…

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.079
It was what my mother wanted.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.720
Do not ask too much for now.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:01.319
I'm leaving.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.240
Your Highness.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.680
Do you like Official Li?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.279
You…

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.480
How dare you speak nonsense.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920
I can already tell.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.079
Come back here.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:20.439
I spent a long time finding this place
to sail and rest.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.590
Consider it thanks for writing
the wine labels for me.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.720
Are you pleased with it?

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.279
I feel it seems to lack something.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.120
Since Your Highness
used the labels I wrote,

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:33.879
should you not invite me
to drink with you?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.480
Well…

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.839
Well…

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.460
Let us speak of it
when there is another chance.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.519
Very well.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.480
I shall wait.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.959
You excel in opera and stories.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.759
I have a story as well.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.879
I wonder if you would like to hear it.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.720
I would like that.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.519
Once,

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.319
there was a Princess
and a scholar-official.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.279
They spoke of no grand vows,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.199
yet they shared

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:26.839
trust and companionship,

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.690
and hearts that understood each other.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.080
Later the Princess fell into danger,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.840
and the scholar promised to save her.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.039
Yet at the final moment,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.320
he betrayed her.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.159
Strangely,

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.159
many years later,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.919
the two met again.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.879
The Princess tormented him in every way,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.519
thinking

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.360
he must hate her deeply.

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.919
But as time passed,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.799
she found

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.399
he had been trying to make amends.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:16.600
I never understood

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.720
why this scholar in the story

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.559
would do such a thing.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.399
If we cannot understand it,

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.720
the story cannot move forward.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.000
If we look from the scholar's view,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.120
perhaps

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:49.399
he never betrayed her at all.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.759
That day,

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.759
the scholar's mentor drugged him,

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.440
and he slept for a full day and night.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.000
When he finally awoke,

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:07.240
the Princess was already gone.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.279
In truth, the Emperor had already suspected

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.340
that the scholar
and the Princess formed a faction.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.200
Yet out of selfishness,

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.080
the mentor protected the scholar alone.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.679
So that is the truth.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:34.000
So it was.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.960
Why has Your Highness never asked

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.200
why the scholar did not explain himself?

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.840
Perhaps because his mentor had passed,

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.679
and he did not wish to stain his name,

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:50.440
nor add to his guilt.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.679
The scholar was upright and loyal,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.120
never one to shift blame.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:58.480
He must have believed

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.440
that no matter how he explained,

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.240
wrong was still wrong,

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:06.159
and if he could not ease her pain,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.960
there was no point speaking of it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.799
Sir,

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:13.960
am I right?

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:15.799
Exactly.

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:20.960
But I have one more question.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.799
Later the Princess learned by chance

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.279
that the scholar
once cared for her mother.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.600
Tell me,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.039
what do you think
they said to each other?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.320
If one day,

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:40.000
you truly feel remorse,

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:42.639
I ask only one last promise.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:45.159
Just one.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.039
Please speak.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.240
If one day,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.960
Pingning returns home safely,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.840
I beg you,

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:04.200
spare her.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:08.000
Do not hurt her again.

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:13.000
I promise you.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.840
And yet, the scholar failed her,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.000
for even that final promise

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.399
was left unfulfilled.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.260
It is snowing.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.780

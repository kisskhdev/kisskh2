I never asked you to carry me.

00:20:19.076 --> 00:20:21.126
I got scared.

00:20:24.206 --> 00:20:32.266
<i>♫ Just like the moment I first met you ♫</i>

00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:36.136
<i>♫ Stay by my side always ♫</i>

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:38.686
<i>♫ I'm only you ♫</i>

00:20:38.686 --> 00:20:42.566
<i>♫ Show me your heart ♫</i>

00:20:42.566 --> 00:20:47.786
<i>♫ I love you forever ♫</i>

00:20:49.026 --> 00:20:51.626
<i>♫ I think of you ♫</i>

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:55.156
<i>♫ You are all I can see ♫</i>

00:20:55.156 --> 00:20:59.346
<i>♫ The fortune came to me like a dream ♫</i>

00:20:59.346 --> 00:21:01.966
<i>♫ I can give you my everything ♫</i>

00:21:01.966 --> 00:21:05.756
<i>♫ That's how beautiful you are ♫</i>

00:21:05.756 --> 00:21:08.346
<i>♫ I'm happy ♫</i>

00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:12.926
<i>♫ My heart is calling for you ♫</i>

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:16.116
Why do you keep getting more clingy?

00:21:16.116 --> 00:21:18.016
Clingy?

00:21:18.016 --> 00:21:21.106
When you put your hand on my back,

00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:23.716
it seemed very intentional.

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:27.046
There are intentions behind our actions.

00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:28.976
You're subtly sneaky, too.

00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:31.776
Being subtle isn't my style.

00:21:31.776 --> 00:21:34.366
I prefer to be blatant.

00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:41.976
Have you no shame?

00:21:41.976 --> 00:21:47.186
That would require me to feel
embarrassed about myself.

00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:48.996
I have nothing to be embarrassed about.

00:21:48.996 --> 00:21:52.596
<i>♫ Shall we begin? ♫</i>

00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:49.446
What a weak-kneed physician.

00:22:49.446 --> 00:22:52.026
How would you make yourself useful?

00:23:04.686 --> 00:23:08.836
I do not think she has a plague.

00:23:08.836 --> 00:23:09.876
Are you sure?

00:23:09.876 --> 00:23:11.646
The symptoms are similar,

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:13.446
but she is recovering differently.

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:15.386
I was so sick I could die.

00:23:15.386 --> 00:23:16.446
She also coughed up blood.

00:23:16.446 --> 00:23:19.206
But she does not have necrosis or sores.

00:23:19.206 --> 00:23:21.816
Most importantly, her pulse is stable.

00:23:21.816 --> 00:23:25.386
I think it is another illness, not a plague.

00:23:25.386 --> 00:23:28.136
Another illness?

00:23:28.136 --> 00:23:34.526
Did you intake or touch anything in particular?

00:23:34.526 --> 00:23:37.166
Try to think carefully.

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:39.456
I was trapped in a room.

00:23:39.456 --> 00:23:42.626
<i>I met Lord Su Gyeom.</i>

00:23:42.626 --> 00:23:45.316
<i>I went to Lady Eun Ae's house and...</i>

00:23:47.746 --> 00:23:51.196
I did meet a Westerner on the streets.

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:53.996
He was in trouble because he was
stranded on his journey.

00:23:53.996 --> 00:23:56.856
I showed him around places.

00:23:57.786 --> 00:24:00.476
Westerner?

00:24:00.476 --> 00:24:03.006
We pray. We pray.

00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:06.806
We pray for Sun Chaek's safe return.

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:11.646
Please let My Lady come back safely.

00:24:15.946 --> 00:24:18.446
Sun Chaek...

00:24:23.116 --> 00:24:25.896
If you would just watch us standing like that,

00:24:25.896 --> 00:24:28.536
just go inside instead.

00:24:30.346 --> 00:24:32.896
A scholar does not believe in superstition.

00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:34.306
Superstition?

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:37.196
Sun Chaek is in danger of dying right now.

00:24:37.196 --> 00:24:40.456
I do not care if it is superstition or not.

00:24:40.456 --> 00:24:41.636
She is right.

00:24:41.636 --> 00:24:44.356
It is about your child's life.
Why should it matter

00:24:44.356 --> 00:24:47.306
whether you are a scholar or a slave?

00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:49.666
If Sun Chaek returns,

00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:53.756
I will grant any of her wishes.

00:24:53.756 --> 00:24:55.256
I pray...

00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:58.216
I will call Sun Chaek "Noonim."

00:24:58.216 --> 00:25:03.136
I do not mind if she gets married before me.

00:25:03.136 --> 00:25:07.856
I already miss her face and voice.

00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:10.486
<i>I said I can walk by myself.</i>

00:25:10.486 --> 00:25:11.966
<i>Put me down.</i>

00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:14.036
Am I hearing things?

00:25:14.036 --> 00:25:18.356
I feel like I could hear her voice.

00:25:18.356 --> 00:25:21.296
<i>Gosh, I'm okay.</i>

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:28.546
Put me down, I said.

00:25:28.546 --> 00:25:29.986
People could see us.

00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:31.446
Noonim!

00:25:31.446 --> 00:25:33.976
- Seriously, put me down.
- Noonim!

00:25:35.006 --> 00:25:36.836
Sun Chaek.

00:25:42.626 --> 00:25:45.506
Is that you, my Sun Chaek?

00:25:45.506 --> 00:25:47.516
You came back alive, did you not?

00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:49.746
- Father.
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:25:49.746 --> 00:25:51.416
Aigoo.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:54.476
Aigoo, my Sun Chaek.

00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:57.696
Your face got so slender.

00:25:57.696 --> 00:26:00.846
You look so worn out.

00:26:00.846 --> 00:26:05.256
The moon heard our prayer.

00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:07.746
Sun Chaek came back alive.

00:26:07.746 --> 00:26:10.396
I am proud of you, my sister.

00:26:11.296 --> 00:26:13.506
I'm okay.

00:26:13.506 --> 00:26:15.676
I'm really okay.

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:18.446
Gosh.

00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:22.686
By the way, what brings you here...

00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:26.846
I was able to return in good health

00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:29.946
thanks to Prince Gyeongseong.

00:26:29.946 --> 00:26:32.586
He saved my life.

00:26:37.366 --> 00:26:39.956
I see.

00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:42.236
Thank you.

00:26:42.236 --> 00:26:43.786
The night air is cold.

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:46.486
Come inside with us.

00:26:51.926 --> 00:26:54.866
I will get going now.

00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:58.056
It is getting late. You should go inside.

00:26:58.056 --> 00:27:00.556
Yes. Well, then.

00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:03.646
- Let us go inside.
- But we should-

00:27:03.646 --> 00:27:04.806
Let us go.

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:07.676
But he saved Sun Chaek...

00:27:07.676 --> 00:27:10.316
Are you really leaving like this?

00:27:14.146 --> 00:27:15.696
If we stay together tonight,

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:18.486
something dangerous might really happen.

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:26.406
Something dangerous? L-Like what, exactly?

00:27:26.406 --> 00:27:29.736
Will there be assassins or swordsmen?

00:27:29.736 --> 00:27:32.746
There is something dangerous

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:34.776
you do not know about.

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:54.186
I am giving you a pass tonight.

00:28:15.943 --> 00:28:19.213
You wanted to see me first thing in the morning.

00:28:19.213 --> 00:28:21.083
What is the reason?

00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:24.953
I heard my marriage was being
arranged behind my back.

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:27.643
How could I delay a moment?

00:28:28.643 --> 00:28:31.533
Royal marriages are under the
Internal Court's jurisdiction.

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:33.513
You must be aware of that.

00:28:33.513 --> 00:28:36.803
Technically speaking, I am not a prince.

00:28:36.803 --> 00:28:38.993
Please stop the selection.

00:28:38.993 --> 00:28:40.603
Through a selection,

00:28:40.603 --> 00:28:44.773
I want to find someone
who is a good match for you.

00:28:44.773 --> 00:28:47.533
Do you not know how this old lady feels?

00:28:47.533 --> 00:28:52.183
I have already found someone
who is a good match for me.

00:28:52.183 --> 00:28:54.043
I am aware.

00:28:54.043 --> 00:28:59.943
But royal marriages are not just
about personal feelings.

00:29:01.463 --> 00:29:03.283
Prince Gyeongseong,

00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:06.513
you are more naive than I thought.

00:29:06.513 --> 00:29:11.403
If you want, that woman can become a concubine.

00:29:11.403 --> 00:29:14.003
There will be only one woman for me.

00:29:14.003 --> 00:29:16.353
Do not argue with me.

00:29:16.353 --> 00:29:19.673
I will consider it an insult, then.

00:29:19.673 --> 00:29:21.673
Leave right now.

00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:32.153
Please remember.

00:29:32.153 --> 00:29:38.353
I politely gave you the last chance
to change your mind.

00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:42.753
- What did you say?
- Do as you wish.

00:29:42.753 --> 00:29:47.273
Things will end up the way I want, anyway.

00:29:47.273 --> 00:29:48.843
What do you mean by that?

00:29:48.843 --> 00:29:53.543
The woman I chose will be selected in the end.

00:29:55.703 --> 00:29:58.203
P-Prince Gyeongseong.

00:30:06.573 --> 00:30:08.603
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:30:11.873 --> 00:30:13.483
A magpie cried this morning.

00:30:13.483 --> 00:30:15.473
I was wondering who I would run into.

00:30:15.473 --> 00:30:17.143
I get to see you here.

00:30:17.143 --> 00:30:19.513
I suppose you just saw the Queen Mother.

00:30:19.513 --> 00:30:20.553
I did.

00:30:20.553 --> 00:30:22.713
I was also on my way to see her.

00:30:22.713 --> 00:30:26.223
You are visiting the Queen Mother's
chamber so early.

00:30:26.223 --> 00:30:28.833
You must be quite close to her.

00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:33.723
Well, I am her favorite among her relatives.

00:30:34.773 --> 00:30:36.533
So, you were her relative.

00:30:36.533 --> 00:30:38.073
My Lord,

00:30:38.073 --> 00:30:42.833
to be honest, I sent an application
for the selection-

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:46.233
Prince Gyeongseong,
could we have a tea together...

00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:47.893
<i>A Westerner?</i>

00:30:47.893 --> 00:30:50.683
Why all of a sudden?

00:30:50.683 --> 00:30:53.513
I think she got involved in something unpleasant.

00:30:54.783 --> 00:30:56.153
All right.

00:30:56.153 --> 00:30:57.943
I will move as quickly as possible.

00:30:57.943 --> 00:30:59.723
And one more thing.

00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:04.573
There is someone I want you to watch.

00:31:08.523 --> 00:31:10.493
Selection process?

00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:14.683
I cannot believe you made such a huge decision
without discussing it with us.

00:31:14.683 --> 00:31:18.063
Did Prince Gyeongseong threaten you?

00:31:18.063 --> 00:31:22.183
He did not. I did it because I wanted to.

00:31:22.183 --> 00:31:25.333
So, please let me.

00:31:25.333 --> 00:31:26.403
I cannot.

00:31:26.403 --> 00:31:29.033
Let her, My Lord.

00:31:29.033 --> 00:31:31.503
Wife, why are you doing this now?

00:31:31.503 --> 00:31:35.933
You said you would grant any
of her wishes if she returned.

00:31:35.933 --> 00:31:40.623
A man cannot go back on his word
from just yesterday.

00:31:40.623 --> 00:31:42.303
Wife,

00:31:42.303 --> 00:31:44.713
we should be stopping this reckless girl-

00:31:44.713 --> 00:31:47.923
Why stop her? We should support her.

00:31:49.103 --> 00:31:51.303
- Wife?
- I gave birth to her and raised her,

00:31:51.303 --> 00:31:55.883
but I have never been happier with her decision.

00:31:55.883 --> 00:31:58.743
She wants to get married ahead of her brothers

00:31:58.743 --> 00:32:01.753
and participate in the
notoriously difficult selection.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.523
I am proud of her courage.

00:32:04.523 --> 00:32:07.963
Sun Chaek, participating in the selection

00:32:07.963 --> 00:32:11.233
is not as simple as you think.

00:32:12.553 --> 00:32:14.923
Do you still feel the same way?

00:32:16.283 --> 00:32:20.313
Father, I understand you are worried,

00:32:20.313 --> 00:32:22.543
but if I cannot participate in the selection,

00:32:22.543 --> 00:32:25.833
I am sure I will regret it later.

00:32:31.623 --> 00:32:34.303
Have faith in our daughter.

00:32:34.303 --> 00:32:39.073
The fact that the Queen Mother is taking
charge of a royal family's marriage.

00:32:39.073 --> 00:32:41.673
It does not seem like an ordinary selection.

00:32:41.673 --> 00:32:43.923
It makes me worry.

00:32:43.923 --> 00:32:46.163
Please do not worry.

00:32:46.163 --> 00:32:49.993
I'm confident I'll exceed your expectations.

00:33:02.303 --> 00:33:04.373
[Cha Sun Chaek]

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.753
Sun Chaek of the Cha family?

00:33:07.753 --> 00:33:12.053
Yes, she is the youngest daughter
of the Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol.

00:33:12.053 --> 00:33:14.623
She sent her application, too?

00:33:14.623 --> 00:33:16.273
Yes.

00:33:16.273 --> 00:33:17.953
That cannot be.

00:33:17.953 --> 00:33:21.523
I was told she was at the plague village.

00:33:21.523 --> 00:33:23.033
Pardon?

00:33:24.793 --> 00:33:26.533
It is nothing.

00:33:26.533 --> 00:33:29.553
Carry on using the registry for now.

00:33:29.553 --> 00:33:34.573
I will start the first round per your order then.

00:33:41.563 --> 00:33:45.453
<i>The woman I chose will be selected in the end.</i>

00:33:46.963 --> 00:33:50.353
Is that why he said that?

00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:52.573
Secretary Do.

00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:56.263
Yes, Queen Mother. Yes.

00:34:00.503 --> 00:34:05.423
I want this selection to be different
than the usual ones

00:34:05.423 --> 00:34:07.943
planned by the Royal Wedding Office.

00:34:07.943 --> 00:34:10.223
Would you like to hear about it?

00:34:11.163 --> 00:34:12.603
Yes.

00:34:22.663 --> 00:34:27.613
I'll bring honor to the Cha family.

00:34:27.613 --> 00:34:29.113
Yes.

00:34:32.413 --> 00:34:34.443
Watch your head, My Lady.

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:42.593
[The first round is about basic manners]

00:34:42.593 --> 00:34:44.633
[The second round is about how cultivated one is]

00:34:44.633 --> 00:34:46.703
[The third round is about
one's character and wisdom]

00:34:47.473 --> 00:34:50.043
<i>I'm a romantic period novel fanatic.</i>

00:34:50.043 --> 00:34:52.723
<i>Of course, I know about the selection.</i>

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:54.433
<i>I've read about it so much that</i>

00:34:54.433 --> 00:34:57.683
<i>I can explain it off the top of my head.</i>

00:35:18.743 --> 00:35:21.193
You sure have great handwriting.

00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:43.903
Is the material for the
Prince Training Hall contest ready?

00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:46.363
Yes.

00:35:55.583 --> 00:35:58.553
It is also nice to look at.

00:35:59.553 --> 00:36:01.323
Thank you.

00:36:10.963 --> 00:36:13.803
Let us go get lunch now.

00:36:13.803 --> 00:36:16.643
How about hot gukbap and makgeolli?

00:36:16.643 --> 00:36:18.913
That is a good idea.

00:36:20.483 --> 00:36:22.783
Why are you not getting up? Do you not want lunch?

00:36:22.783 --> 00:36:25.033
Gukbap is not my favorite.

00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:26.893
Why not? It is delicious.

00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:29.303
For me, gukbap is...

00:36:29.303 --> 00:36:33.283
The smell and the look of it feel barbaric.

00:36:33.283 --> 00:36:34.763
Do not act superior.

00:36:34.763 --> 00:36:36.923
I am not. It is a matter of taste.

00:36:36.923 --> 00:36:38.173
Please respect it.

00:36:38.173 --> 00:36:41.083
Of course, Mr. Calligrapher.

00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:42.783
By the way, did you hear?

00:36:42.783 --> 00:36:45.423
There will be a royal spouse selection
at the Palace soon.

00:36:45.423 --> 00:36:47.193
You mean for Prince Gyeongseong?

00:36:47.193 --> 00:36:49.233
Hold on.

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:51.773
Selection for Prince Gyeongseong?

00:36:51.773 --> 00:36:53.943
What do you mean by that?

00:37:05.403 --> 00:37:07.403
Lady Eun Ae?

00:37:09.233 --> 00:37:10.923
Gosh, My Lady.

00:37:10.923 --> 00:37:12.823
What are you doing here...

00:37:12.823 --> 00:37:14.153
Because my father insisted,

00:37:14.153 --> 00:37:16.903
I will also be participating in the selection.

00:37:16.903 --> 00:37:18.453
Your father?

00:37:18.453 --> 00:37:19.573
Yes.

00:37:19.573 --> 00:37:23.143
He even purchased a fake nobility note.

00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:27.223
<i>If Eun Ae participates in the selection,</i>

00:37:27.223 --> 00:37:29.793
<i>does it make her my competition?</i>

00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:31.393
<i>By chance,</i>

00:37:31.393 --> 00:37:35.003
<i>will Eun Ae and Yi Beon be able to connect again?</i>

00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:38.683
<i>This world is too unpredictable.</i>

00:37:41.183 --> 00:37:43.633
I hope you are not mistaken.

00:37:43.633 --> 00:37:47.023
I am still scared of Prince Gyeongseong.
I do not like him.

00:37:47.023 --> 00:37:50.043
I do not even want to be married to him

00:37:50.043 --> 00:37:53.383
even in my dreams.

00:37:53.383 --> 00:37:56.433
Would you be okay being here, then?

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:01.003
My father said it was his dream.

00:38:01.003 --> 00:38:03.483
You're doing this just to be filial.

00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:05.903
I admire your filial heart, Lady Eun Ae.

00:38:05.903 --> 00:38:08.523
It is my duty.

00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:14.873
I hope I do not get in
between you and Prince Gyeongseong.

00:38:14.873 --> 00:38:17.103
- Not at all.
- Do not worry.

00:38:17.103 --> 00:38:20.203
I will get disqualified quickly
since I lack in many ways.

00:38:20.203 --> 00:38:23.943
I hope you have a good result.

00:38:28.593 --> 00:38:33.213
Gosh, I hear vulgar and unpleasant noises.

00:38:33.213 --> 00:38:34.913
My Lady.

00:38:38.743 --> 00:38:41.913
<i>What is Cha Sun Chaek doing here?</i>

00:38:41.913 --> 00:38:44.033
<i>Why is she not sick?</i>

00:38:44.033 --> 00:38:46.303
You look like you saw a ghost.

00:38:46.303 --> 00:38:51.263
You are not happy to see me, either. Am I wrong?

00:38:52.523 --> 00:38:55.993
Here is your fan, My Lady.

00:38:55.993 --> 00:38:58.783
The world must be coming to an end.

00:38:58.783 --> 00:39:00.823
Even dogs and cows are
participating in the selection.

00:39:00.823 --> 00:39:02.333
Dogs and cows?

00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:05.583
You are going too far.

00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:07.973
A lowlife like you are
participating in the selection?

00:39:07.973 --> 00:39:10.163
I can hear the sound of the royal family's

00:39:10.163 --> 00:39:12.813
authority falling all the way from here.

00:39:12.813 --> 00:39:17.593
I will show the difference between
a noblewoman and a lowlife like you.

00:39:17.593 --> 00:39:21.143
I know I will get disqualified in the first round.

00:39:21.143 --> 00:39:22.533
You don't know that.

00:39:22.533 --> 00:39:24.963
You never know until you compete.

00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:28.933
Gosh. What a touching friendship.

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.903
They say, "Heukimjamuk."

00:39:30.903 --> 00:39:32.473
If you stay close to something dirty,

00:39:32.473 --> 00:39:35.373
you end up getting dirty, too.

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:38.533
You mean, "Geunmukjaheuk."

00:39:38.533 --> 00:39:43.433
What kind of food is "Heukimjamuk?"

00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:48.033
You will regret ignoring my warning.

00:39:48.033 --> 00:39:49.943
Cho Eun Ae or whatever her name is...

00:39:49.943 --> 00:39:54.883
You never know what sly nature she is
hiding behind her innocent face.

00:39:54.883 --> 00:39:56.683
It takes one to know one, they say.

00:39:56.683 --> 00:39:58.483
What did you say?

00:39:58.483 --> 00:40:02.273
All right. Line up and go inside in order.

00:40:02.273 --> 00:40:03.963
Let's go.

00:40:12.663 --> 00:40:15.243
<i>It is a ritual for the Kitchen God.</i>

00:40:15.243 --> 00:40:18.993
<i>It signals the beginning of the selection.</i>

00:40:31.173 --> 00:40:35.563
The cauldron knob never bent before.

00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:38.463
Does this signal something?

00:40:41.093 --> 00:40:42.773
I dodged a bad omen.

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:45.013
I dodged it.

00:40:49.753 --> 00:40:53.523
The first round of the selection will commence.

00:40:53.523 --> 00:40:58.283
The Queen Mother gave you this task herself.

00:40:58.283 --> 00:41:00.423
It is called,

00:41:00.423 --> 00:41:04.563
"Triathlon Fitness Battle."

00:41:04.563 --> 00:41:08.963
<i>Health is one of the three criteria
for women, along with intelligence and heart.</i>

00:41:10.703 --> 00:41:16.013
Especially the royal women
need to be stronger than anyone.

00:41:16.013 --> 00:41:23.183
Women of this country carried
cannonballs themselves during wars

00:41:23.183 --> 00:41:27.953
and overcame crises alongside men
throughout our history.

00:41:27.953 --> 00:41:29.383
Therefore,

00:41:30.383 --> 00:41:34.493
you lift up this cannonball...

00:41:38.853 --> 00:41:40.753
Lift it up and

00:41:40.753 --> 00:41:43.303
toss it past that line.

00:41:43.303 --> 00:41:47.173
The ones who succeed will pass this round.

00:41:47.173 --> 00:41:50.963
Who wants to toss it first?

00:41:52.503 --> 00:41:54.533
What do I do?

00:41:55.853 --> 00:42:00.223
Is there anyone who wants to go first?

00:42:00.223 --> 00:42:02.633
I will give it a try.

00:42:02.633 --> 00:42:04.593
How admirable.

00:42:04.593 --> 00:42:07.823
Bring her the cannonball.

00:42:23.293 --> 00:42:25.313
Toss it!

00:42:30.433 --> 00:42:32.603
She passed!

00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:34.863
Good job.

00:42:34.863 --> 00:42:37.843
You did a great job.

00:42:43.293 --> 00:42:48.413
All right. Start tossing it in order.

00:42:55.173 --> 00:42:56.853
She passed!

00:42:56.853 --> 00:42:58.093
She failed!

00:42:58.093 --> 00:42:59.603
She passed!

00:42:59.603 --> 00:43:02.193
She failed!

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:05.393
She passed!

00:43:06.363 --> 00:43:09.653
She failed!

00:43:17.023 --> 00:43:19.513
She passed!

00:43:19.513 --> 00:43:22.543
All she got is brute force.

00:43:23.563 --> 00:43:26.623
She failed!

00:43:27.743 --> 00:43:30.183
She passed!

00:43:38.993 --> 00:43:41.513
<i>Is it really this heavy?</i>

00:43:49.803 --> 00:43:52.433
<i>No, don't get scared.</i>

00:43:52.433 --> 00:43:56.573
<i>Sports are about science, not force.</i>

00:44:05.803 --> 00:44:08.383
<i>Apply pressure to the core.</i>

00:44:08.383 --> 00:44:12.073
<i>Using the centrifugal force...</i>

00:44:12.073 --> 00:44:16.193
<i>toss it the moment you feel certain.</i>

00:44:20.223 --> 00:44:22.533
She passed!

00:44:38.563 --> 00:44:39.803
What brings you here?

00:44:39.803 --> 00:44:42.453
How could you not tell me about your selection?

00:44:42.453 --> 00:44:44.543
I am very disappointed.

00:44:53.423 --> 00:44:56.543
The selection was planned behind your back.

00:44:56.543 --> 00:44:58.793
You are finally facing a hardship, too.

00:44:58.793 --> 00:45:00.813
This is not much of a hardship.

00:45:00.813 --> 00:45:02.723
Do not be so confident.

00:45:02.723 --> 00:45:05.713
If another woman gets selected,

00:45:05.713 --> 00:45:07.123
what would you do then?

00:45:07.123 --> 00:45:10.893
I can easily cancel the selection result.

00:45:10.893 --> 00:45:12.533
If you can,

00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:15.493
why are you letting the selection happen?

00:45:17.213 --> 00:45:19.803
Just like in hunting,

00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:22.793
everything has its moment.

00:45:22.793 --> 00:45:23.973
Hunting?

00:45:23.973 --> 00:45:28.183
I am suspicious that this selection started at all.

00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:30.873
I am thinking of finding out the reason.

00:45:30.873 --> 00:45:32.433
And...

00:45:34.473 --> 00:45:38.733
hardships aren't necessarily bad.

00:45:41.843 --> 00:45:44.243
What are you so entertained by?

00:45:47.693 --> 00:45:49.393
This is so you.

00:45:49.393 --> 00:45:51.463
You were watching this...

00:46:11.863 --> 00:46:14.533
Only the maidens who hit the bullseye

00:46:14.533 --> 00:46:17.373
can move on to the next stage.

00:46:29.443 --> 00:46:30.833
She passed.

00:46:55.693 --> 00:46:58.583
Something is strange over there.

00:47:01.643 --> 00:47:03.053
She passed!

00:47:04.153 --> 00:47:06.833
I-It worked.

00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:09.423
It was obviously suspicious.

00:47:09.423 --> 00:47:11.353
This is not fair.

00:47:11.353 --> 00:47:13.153
If you do not shoot at a count of 10,

00:47:13.153 --> 00:47:16.373
I will disqualify you.

00:47:35.813 --> 00:47:39.143
Even the best archer could not
hit the bullseye in this weather.

00:47:39.143 --> 00:47:44.713
This is also a part of her fate.

00:47:44.713 --> 00:47:46.753
You cheated.

00:47:46.753 --> 00:47:49.063
How dare you speak of fate?

00:47:49.063 --> 00:47:51.253
I will have to show her...

00:47:51.253 --> 00:47:55.353
that fate can change.

00:48:01.913 --> 00:48:03.783
Ten!

00:48:03.783 --> 00:48:07.463
I'm Jumong's descendant.

00:48:07.463 --> 00:48:10.203
Korea is a nation of archery.

00:48:10.203 --> 00:48:12.183
Seven!

00:48:12.183 --> 00:48:15.993
Sun Chaek better not delay too much.

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:18.113
Five!

00:48:18.113 --> 00:48:20.553
Four!

00:48:20.553 --> 00:48:23.063
<i>You don't calculate the wind.</i>

00:48:23.063 --> 00:48:24.553
Three!

00:48:24.553 --> 00:48:27.883
<i>- You overcome it.</i>
- Two!

00:48:28.863 --> 00:48:31.263
One!

00:48:33.433 --> 00:48:35.623
Wow!

00:48:36.573 --> 00:48:39.943
Even with this strong wind!

00:48:46.771 --> 00:48:48.513
Do not look him in the eye.

00:48:49.273 --> 00:48:51.513
Oh, no, hurry.

00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:53.383
Hurry.

00:48:55.653 --> 00:49:00.023
<i>I found the Westerner who approached Lady Cha.</i>

00:49:00.023 --> 00:49:03.693
<i>I think he came off of a ship
that arrived about six days ago.</i>

00:49:03.693 --> 00:49:06.143
Six days ago?

00:49:09.623 --> 00:49:11.453
<i>He and Lady Cha went to a tavern, a fabric shop,</i>

00:49:11.453 --> 00:49:14.143
<i>and other places together.</i>

00:49:14.143 --> 00:49:18.363
<i>He is currently staying at an inn that
the fabric shop owner recommended.</i>

00:49:23.973 --> 00:49:27.593
<i>He did not display plague symptoms.</i>

00:50:10.493 --> 00:50:12.343
I am here to pick up my clothes.

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:15.293
You came with Lady Sun Chaek last time.

00:50:15.293 --> 00:50:17.313
I will bring them out now.

00:50:18.893 --> 00:50:21.483
He speaks our language well, by the way.

00:51:48.473 --> 00:51:51.353
This is the last stage of the first round.

00:51:51.353 --> 00:51:54.493
Deliver refreshments for the internal court ladies

00:51:54.493 --> 00:51:56.973
who are working hard.

00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:17.413
Get started.

00:52:38.023 --> 00:52:41.343
My Lady, the porridge
on the left is about to spill.

00:52:41.343 --> 00:52:42.713
Thank you.

00:52:42.713 --> 00:52:44.213
It's slippery here. Be careful.

00:52:44.213 --> 00:52:45.623
Okay.

00:52:49.403 --> 00:52:51.243
You wasted food that our countrymen

00:52:51.243 --> 00:52:53.983
grew with blood, sweat, and tears.

00:52:53.983 --> 00:52:55.503
You failed.

00:52:56.423 --> 00:53:00.663
<i>Don't underestimate a resident
of a hilltop neighborhood.</i>

00:53:22.433 --> 00:53:24.083
You failed.

00:53:29.963 --> 00:53:31.603
The bowls you broke are...

00:53:31.603 --> 00:53:35.723
precious white porcelain, the Princess' favorite.

00:53:35.723 --> 00:53:37.363
You failed.

00:53:52.283 --> 00:53:55.473
I guess no experience is useless.

00:54:35.583 --> 00:54:37.353
Are you okay?

00:54:37.353 --> 00:54:41.993
I might die before the selection ends.

00:54:44.833 --> 00:54:47.973
Anyway, thanks for your help today.

00:54:48.913 --> 00:54:50.473
Do not mention it.

00:54:50.473 --> 00:54:53.963
You helped me a lot, too.

00:54:53.963 --> 00:54:55.833
<i>Don't smile like that.</i>

00:54:55.833 --> 00:54:58.023
<i>I'm your competitor.</i>

00:54:58.023 --> 00:55:00.343
<i>You need to defeat me.</i>

00:55:00.343 --> 00:55:05.193
I feel secure that you are with me.

00:55:05.193 --> 00:55:07.583
<i>But I feel uncomfortable.</i>

00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:12.243
<i>I'm sorry, sweet Lady Eun Ae.</i>

00:55:12.243 --> 00:55:14.513
Why do you look so down?

00:55:14.513 --> 00:55:17.993
You said we should work hard
without being discouraged.

00:55:17.993 --> 00:55:19.553
Let us do well until the end.

00:55:19.553 --> 00:55:22.213
But what would be the point?

00:55:22.213 --> 00:55:25.653
I think someone was already chosen internally.

00:55:27.443 --> 00:55:31.153
You saw Do Hwa Seon cheating, right?

00:55:40.573 --> 00:55:43.363
Is there anyone who does not know that?

00:55:43.363 --> 00:55:46.173
I hope we aren't playing sidekicks to Do Hwa Seon

00:55:46.173 --> 00:55:50.033
when the decision was already made.

00:55:50.033 --> 00:55:51.413
Geez.

00:55:51.413 --> 00:55:55.143
Thinking that makes me so angry.

00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:57.323
My Lady, if nothing had changed,

00:55:57.323 --> 00:56:01.223
I would not have been able
to participate in this selection.

00:56:01.223 --> 00:56:02.803
I was born an orphan.

00:56:02.803 --> 00:56:05.473
No matter how wealthy my stepfather is,

00:56:05.473 --> 00:56:08.433
he is nothing but a merchant.

00:56:08.433 --> 00:56:11.753
But while he was growing his business,

00:56:11.753 --> 00:56:14.253
he was able to change his status.

00:56:14.253 --> 00:56:17.633
And I got to participate in the selection, too.

00:56:18.613 --> 00:56:20.263
Lady Eun Ae.

00:56:20.263 --> 00:56:23.183
Now, I think...

00:56:23.183 --> 00:56:26.803
nothing in this world was predetermined.

00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:29.973
All we have is this moment.

00:56:36.113 --> 00:56:38.013
Was that out of line?

00:56:38.013 --> 00:56:39.663
No.

00:56:39.663 --> 00:56:42.313
You're so admirable.

00:56:42.313 --> 00:56:45.743
"Nothing is predetermined in this world."

00:56:46.683 --> 00:56:48.913
It's such a cool idea.

00:56:56.343 --> 00:56:58.743
I wonder if the test went well.

00:56:58.743 --> 00:57:01.373
I wonder if she caused trouble.

00:57:10.233 --> 00:57:13.523
The person I saw was indeed Maiden Eun Ae.

00:57:14.423 --> 00:57:17.423
Why did she participate
in Prince Gyeongseong's selection?

00:57:19.103 --> 00:57:21.013
No.

00:57:21.013 --> 00:57:23.253
No...

00:57:23.253 --> 00:57:25.613
This cannot be true.

00:57:28.493 --> 00:57:30.233
Right.

00:57:30.233 --> 00:57:32.703
I was worried most about Eun Ae,

00:57:32.703 --> 00:57:36.273
but she said the present moment matters the most.

00:57:37.333 --> 00:57:40.113
Let's stop feeling guilty.

00:57:41.323 --> 00:57:43.573
Just focus on what's ahead.

00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:49.783
Is talking to yourself a trend these days?

00:57:54.903 --> 00:57:57.833
I don't even have the energy to be surprised.

00:57:57.833 --> 00:58:01.653
Do not say you already failed the first round.

00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:03.513
What do you mean, fail?

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:07.273
I hung in there with all my might and passed.

00:58:07.273 --> 00:58:09.423
The whole thing was already set up for Do Hwa Seon.

00:58:09.423 --> 00:58:12.653
Do you know how hard I worked?

00:58:12.653 --> 00:58:15.113
Look. My legs are shaking.

00:58:15.113 --> 00:58:18.133
Lady Eun Ae and I were so flustered.

00:58:20.173 --> 00:58:21.903
You know Lady Eun Ae, right?

00:58:21.903 --> 00:58:24.383
- At the Seonmun Club meeting-
- I am not interested.

00:58:24.383 --> 00:58:28.343
All I am interested in is you, Cha Sun Chaek.

00:58:30.643 --> 00:58:34.373
So, no matter what the test is,

00:58:34.373 --> 00:58:36.473
make sure to pass.

00:58:36.473 --> 00:58:38.303
Getting married is important,

00:58:38.303 --> 00:58:42.803
but I'll make sure to win
for the sake of my dignity.

00:58:52.503 --> 00:58:57.483
Prove yourself as the female lead who suits me.

00:58:57.483 --> 00:58:59.063
If it is for winning,

00:58:59.063 --> 00:59:01.473
I will let you do anything.

00:59:01.473 --> 00:59:03.063
But...

00:59:03.063 --> 00:59:07.013
I cannot forgive you if you hurt yourself.

00:59:29.903 --> 00:59:31.413
Let's go.

00:59:55.073 --> 00:59:58.173
For the second round of the selection today,

00:59:58.173 --> 01:00:00.033
out of intelligence, heart, and health,

01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:03.293
we will assess the intelligence.

01:00:41.823 --> 01:00:47.203
In the pouches, there are 10 nyang worth of coins.

01:00:47.203 --> 01:00:53.313
Increase the worth of 10 nyang in two days.

01:00:53.313 --> 01:00:59.563
That is the task I am giving you.

01:01:16.463 --> 01:01:17.823
<i>My Lady,</i>

01:01:17.823 --> 01:01:21.583
<i>nothing is predetermined in this world.</i>

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:23.923
That's an admirable idea.

01:01:23.923 --> 01:01:28.433
I'm so impressed with you, Lady Eun Ae.

01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:30.833
<i>After being moved by Eun Ae's words,</i>

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:33.033
<i>Sun Chaek felt at ease.</i>

01:01:33.033 --> 01:01:37.473
<i>It's probably because
of the guilt she's been having.</i>

01:01:37.473 --> 01:01:41.653
<i>But what Eun Ae said to Sun Chaek wasn't for her.</i>

01:01:41.653 --> 01:01:44.693
<i>It was more of a promise to herself.</i>

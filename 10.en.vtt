00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.786
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.866
[The animal scenes were staged, in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.030
I do not want you to
incur any more grievances.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.946
What does that mean?

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.000
It means I don't want you to kill people.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.490
By chance,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.826
do you believe what Prince Seonghyeon said?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.210
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.090
Do you not trust me?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.066
If I killed him,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.926
will you call me a murderer

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.556
and run away again?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.406
You know that's not what I meant.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.020
I said to avoid him because
he is dangerous. Is that so hard?

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.866
Stay away from Prince Seonghyeon.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.236
This is an order.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.116
I wish you didn't hide things from me.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.176
Do you still think I killed that man?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.526
- It's not that.
- Fine. This is great.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.866
I might as well kill
everyone in the market.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.650
How much longer will you
have blood on your hands?

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.526
<i>He must be possessed by a murderous spirit.</i>

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.966
<i>He's way too young.</i>

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.426
<i>How could he do that as a human?</i>

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.806
<i>He is not a human.</i>

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.556
<i>He is a dog. A hunting dog.</i>

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.876
<i>Whoever is near Prince Gyeongseong</i>

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.720
<i>will die.</i>

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.516
This might be your opportunity
to stop being called

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.356
a hunting dog or a murderous spirit.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.050
I do not need such an opportunity.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.230
This is not what I saw
when I read your mind.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.086
I know you're lonelier and
tormented than anyone.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.550
But why do you let
people misunderstand you?

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.220
You said you know everything about me,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.370
but you do not understand me at all.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.780
I had better leave for the night.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.440
[Episode 10: Destiny strikes again]

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.160
I took care of it as you ordered.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.620
You are back to being the
old Prince Gyeongseong again.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.830
My Lord!

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.050
It is cold. Why are you outside?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.736
Because I do not feel at ease.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.766
You must have argued with Lady Cha.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.536
I know just by looking
at your face, My Lord.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.816
Do not worry.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.630
A lovers' quarrel does not last.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.516
Even a fight like that is a luxury to me.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.436
Why would you say that?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.640
Just like the rumors say,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.100
I wonder if everyone near me

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.676
ends up miserable.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.406
Gosh, that is not true.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.046
I am here to prove that wrong.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.180
You do not know how happy
I am to serve you, My Lord.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.426
<i>Make sure the body is</i>

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.250
<i>discovered at the downstream.</i>

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.756
Don't look at me so scary.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.306
What do you want from me?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.076
I do not want anything from you.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.710
Just stay the same as before.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.666
Stay as Cha Sun Chaek's
trusty friend as you are now.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.426
So, she listens to you and relies on you.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.916
I will decide what you will tell her.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.346
By the way,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.956
what would you gain by doing this?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.680
You will find out soon.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.280
It will not be fun

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.520
to spoil it in advance.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.230
Was I too harsh?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.380
Prince Gyeongseong seemed very hurt.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.416
I don't know.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.376
Where did things go wrong?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.626
<i>You said you know everything about me,</i>

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.526
<i>but you do not understand me at all.</i>

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.816
<i>I already know how
difficult of a past you had.</i>

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.430
<i>So, I just wanted to
help you move on from it.</i>

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.686
<i>My Lady!</i>

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.320
<i>Lady Eun Ae is here.</i>

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.100
Yes, let her in.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.156
My Lady, you were up.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.306
What brings you here so early?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.556
I wanted to help you
prepare for the wedding.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.126
Is something going on, My Lady?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.376
The bride should be at her peak now.
But you do not look so well.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.866
It is nothing.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.376
I hope it is not because of the rumor.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.706
Rumor?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.680
The thing is...

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.236
Prince Gyeongseong apparently
killed a prime minister

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.476
- who is in exile.
- Pardon?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.276
He was respected since
the former king was in power.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.546
That must be why there is a lot of talk.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.866
They say the bloodshed started again

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.060
and the hunting dog cannot help himself.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.266
Although Prince Gyeongseong
must have followed the King's order.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.266
It is just a rumor.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.086
It hasn't been confirmed, either.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.590
R-Right.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.790
I should not have told you.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.750
Do not worry.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.226
How long am I supposed to do this?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.086
Start the silence training all over again.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.100
A-Again? Says who?

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.780
Do you think you could

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.320
scare me staring like that?

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.036
You still have a long way to go.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.460
Reflect on your sins through silence.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.536
Why would he hit me? Seriously.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.640
<i>Monk, please come out for a moment.</i>

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.120
I did not commit a sin.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.210
Not this time.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.686
Right.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.276
To prove my innocence,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.690
I will have to find the culprit
instead of meditating.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.386
Yes, I am the embodiment of revenge.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.450
No, revenge equals Do Hwa Seon.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.710
Away! Go away!

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.706
Stop blocking the path and move.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.886
Hold on.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.036
I said move.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.890
Seriously. Hold on a moment, I said

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.236
I thought you were a beggar.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.556
But it was you.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.560
What? A beggar?

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.166
There is the Right State Minister.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.356
Should I call him for you?

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.456
You be quiet.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.076
Do not touch me with your dirty hand.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.876
What? Dirty?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.546
You are finally showing your true color.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.356
Take a good look at yourself instead.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.340
What? Seriously.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.866
My gosh.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.326
Look who is here.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.150
What a miserable sight.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.200
What were you talking about here?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:07.220
Lady Hwa Seon must still
find me to be an eyesore.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.476
What did you just say?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.836
Try running that big mouth again.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.226
Gosh, she is so crude.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.206
I cannot deal with you.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.686
Are you crazy?

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.176
Do not fight because of me.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.386
The Dahong Club meeting
preparation is almost ready.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.766
I will let you know soon.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.676
D-Dahong Club? Without me?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.986
At your tea house?

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.506
Lady Eun Ae will lead the club from now on.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.476
Excuse us, then.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.210
- Excuse us.
- Let us go, My Lady.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.316
You are radiant today, Lady Eun Ae.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.406
You are too kind.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.430
Seriously!

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.270
So, you are treating
me like a culprit, too?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.746
Just wait and see.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.350
I will catch the culprit.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.190
Gosh, My Lord.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.686
Were you waiting for me?

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.500
I need to talk to you urgently.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.886
People can see us. You cannot do this.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.010
What if people get the wrong idea?

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.490
I am the one

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.590
who wants to resolve a misunderstanding.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.520
What is this?

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:21.550
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.660
Please explain properly

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.940
so I can understand.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.490
[Come to Cheonggyecheon,
where we first met. I will be waiting.]

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.220
You are not mistaken.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.506
What you are thinking is correct.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.706
My Lady, what do you mean

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.116
I lured Lady Cha with a fake letter

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.190
and had her kidnapped at Cheonggyecheon.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.616
Are you satisfied to hear
what you wanted to hear?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.846
How...

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.150
How could you do something so evil?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.286
Your innocent face makes me

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.146
feel like such a terrible person.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.816
Why did you do that?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.636
Tell me the reason, at least.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.426
You would never understand.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:31.350
The ones who were born with
everything could never understand why.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:41.016
No reason in the world
can justify hurting people.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.756
Please

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.580
confess now.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.606
I have no interest in doing so.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.516
If you keep acting like this,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.140
I have no choice but to
tell Prince Gyeongseong.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.380
What a touching friendship.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.230
Yes, do that.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.450
But I am not sure if you
know this, by the way.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.626
Your father is a member
of the Heuksa Clan that.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.966
Prince Gyeongseong has
been fighting for decades.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.776
How ludicrous!

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.540
It is not ludicrous. It is the truth.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:38.490
If you are curious, ask the Chief Secretary
yourself and confirm.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.600
Culprits always return to the crime scene.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.980
Are you the culprit, then?

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.830
Now that I think about it,
the culprit is already dead.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.596
Why are you telling me that now?

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.226
Because we just met.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.340
Our fates brought us here.
It was nice to meet you.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.750
If I put myself in the culprit's shoes,
I thought I might think of a clue.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.450
Crazy bastard. Seriously.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.820
She asked for help with this?

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.650
Cha Sun Chaek sure is lucky.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.726
Are you following me around by chance?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.060
I think it is the opposite.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.250
Stop following me.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.460
The first one was a miss

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.120
and the second one was accurate.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.236
A silver dagger♪...
(Used by women for self-defense)

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.450
And a medium sword inflicted two wounds.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.780
The silver dagger missed,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.220
and the sword stabbed
the vital spot exactly.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.930
Did the woman

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.656
have an accomplice?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.006
My Lord.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.146
What is going on?

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.136
His Majesty is looking for you urgently.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.920
His Majesty?

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.010
Did you wait long?

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.736
No, Your Majesty.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.450
I was waiting,

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.236
for you to confess your sin,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.410
and repent.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.506
- What do you mean-
- Prince Gyeongseong,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.086
you promised to be loyal to me.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.980
Do you remember?

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.326
Are you truthful with me?

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:06.240
Are you sure you are not
hiding anything from me?

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.586
Were you going to fake his death

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.170
and hide him away?

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.196
That is not the case at all.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.596
I just wanted to delay it.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.650
Why did you want to delay it?

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.466
I asked him to wait until

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.196
my daughter's wedding.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.736
Shut your mouth.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.716
How dare a sinner talk to His Majesty?

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.640
Did he affect you enough
to go against my order?

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.180
Today, I killed you with my sword.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.836
Have you softened up or

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.190
did you have a change of heart?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.376
Your Majesty,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.166
what Prince Gyeongseong attempted
is tantamount to treason.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.976
I agree.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.716
Unless he sided with the minister,

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.256
how could he go against your order

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.130
and make a false report?

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.276
For going against your order,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.876
please punish him harshly.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.246
<i>Punish him harshly.</i>

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.886
Your Majesty,

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:12.086
he has been in exile as
punishment for a long time.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.146
Revisiting the past and blaming
him for his old crime

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.976
would not be approved by the people.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.366
Even the Book of Law says one should
not be punished for sins from the past.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.356
Displaying your generosity

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.696
would be a good way to set an
example and be a good lesson.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.270
Please listen to my plea.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.396
Sins from the past?

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.816
Yes.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.076
The Chief State Minister
makes a good point.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.216
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.536
I will be generous and

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.210
give Prince Gyeongseong one more chance.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.966
Kill this man in front of me now.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.736
Then, I will let go of your past error.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.440
Your Majesty.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.630
Are you refusing or incapable?

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.830
Thank you.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.160
I heard the wedding
went well, thanks to you.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.090
I am all right.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.910
Kill me.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.280
What are you doing? Kill him now!

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.230
<i>Don't kill.</i>

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.460
<i>I do not want you to
incur any more grievances.</i>

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.020
Please kill me, Your Majesty!

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.456
Prince Seonghyeon.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.076
I crossed the line, Your Majesty.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.660
But I could not just sit and watch.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.386
It is okay. It is okay.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.850
I feel relieved, as if an enormous
burden has been lifted.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.956
Prince Gyeongseong will be
stripped from his position now.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.410
Wait for my disciplinary
action for the dismissal.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.290
Why did you do that?

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.960
That was so out of character for you.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.416
It was your doing.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.206
Why are you doing this?

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.656
Not only you disobeyed the King's order,

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.656
you dared to make a false report to him!

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.706
Is this how you show your claws?

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.990
What is it that you want?

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.460
That's why

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.756
you should have done your job properly.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.700
This would not have happened, then.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.120
[The Obsessive Tyrant]

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.320
Pardon?

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.116
Prince Gyeongseong was
stripped of his position?

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.316
He did not kill the man
His Majesty ordered him to kill

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.630
and made a false report.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.126
Because the man had pleaded
with him for his daughter

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.400
who was about to wed.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.850
<i>You said you know everything about me,</i>

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.920
<i>but you do not understand me at all.</i>

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.240
<i>Do you not trust me?</i>

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.620
What brings you to my room at this hour?

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.420
Cut your ties with Prince Gyeongseong.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.140
What

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.746
do you mean by that?

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.296
You will die if you stay by his side.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.456
Father.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.680
Have you sided with Prince Seonghyeon?

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.260
Is Prince Seonghyeon

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.086
behind the Heuksa Clan?

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.880
- How did you know?
- Answer my question.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.876
I thought you were completely oblivious.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.850
I am impressed.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.406
The owner of the Palace will change

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.086
and the new world will begin soon.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.286
Does Prince Gyeongseong need
to be gone to achieve that?

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:02.256
The puppet king has
been able to stay in power

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.666
all because of Prince Gyeongseong.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.370
He needs to be eliminated first.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.596
You have a duty.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.360
Submit a petition and request
the execution of Prince Gyeongseong.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:25.226
You must know well how
important my mission is.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.270
So, risk your life for it, too.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.996
Prince Gyeongseong
seems to be a dying flame.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:58.306
I no longer know which rope to hold onto.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.600
What do you think?

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.136
Father,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.400
I gained a new card.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.160
Are you all right?

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.040
I heard about what happened.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.816
As you were concerned,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.260
I ended up falling out
of His Majesty's favor.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.076
You had better not come here for a while.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.160
Being friendly with me

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.610
will not help you at all.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.210
There is something I need to tell you.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.516
You are not even shocked

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.410
as if you were expecting me.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.806
I see Sir Su Gyeom already tattled on me.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.776
You killed, but you have no remorse.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.366
Who is your accomplice?

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.136
I did it alone.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.156
I found a trace of an accomplice
in the kidnapper's body.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.630
Tell me the truth.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.910
How long did you think you could deceive?

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.946
You would not feel wronged
even if you died like this.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.496
Sure. Go ahead and kill me.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.820
If you want to commit another
murder despite Lady Cha's wish.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.306
I guess you actually love Lady Cha.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:12.306
But a person's true color never changes.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:17.140
You must know that better
than anyone, My Lord.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.136
If you do not reveal your accomplice,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.446
I will send you to the Royal
Investigation Bureau. Decide wisely.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.670
The store you built with
your father might be in danger.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.530
She is Lady Cha's close friend.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:01.200
What will you tell Lady Cha?

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.200
Watch her carefully.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.830
Cho Eun Ae

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.390
got caught by Prince Gyeongseong?

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.776
Murderous spirit.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.876
Evil murderer!

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.840
You killed my husband, didn't you?

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.636
How many people have you killed?

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.410
No!

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.176
Stop throwing it!

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.240
Move!

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.280
Bring my husband back!

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.180
Bring my husband back!

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.640
Bring him back to life!

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.830
What you did today could
have put you in danger.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.320
You always live in danger.

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.520
I'm sorry for misjudging you.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.726
I was all talk.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.100
I guess I didn't understand
you with my heart.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.516
You are the first person
who stepped in for me,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.336
Cha Sun Chaek.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.430
I can continue to do anything for you.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.590
I'm so sorry for hurting you.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.610
I am

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.720
also sorry.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.146
All of this is because of my shameful past

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.800
I want to put behind.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.846
I have a terrible past

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.480
that could make you want
to leave if you found out.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:40.196
When His Majesty rose to the throne,

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.106
Prince Seonghyeon's parents,

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:46.946
my uncle and aunt were killed.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.036
I was there then.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.700
But

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.650
to protect my family,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.936
I sided with His Majesty.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.700
I would've done the same.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:07.466
I understand why Prince
Seonghyeon hates me.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:12.536
Because I do, I can sense
how dangerous his hatred is.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.336
I have been afraid of his pent-up
anger from the past dozen years

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.416
and I lost my mind when I saw you with him.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.440
I did not want his resentment
toward me to hurt you.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.360
Don't say things like that.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.416
Just because

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.016
I asked you not to kill anyone,

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.536
you tried to change.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.830
You want to leave your dark past
behind more than anyone.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.146
I know that.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.036
For you to be able to do that

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.886
and have nothing but happiness ahead,

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.990
I will help you.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.320
I will make sure of it.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:41.386
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.480
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.236
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.230
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:03.946
Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:08.230
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.136
I am not happy about it,

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.286
but the only person His
Majesty listens to now

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.890
seems to be Prince Seonghyeon.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.600
It is you, Sun Chaek.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.216
It is cold. Come inside.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.860
No.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.416
I'll talk to you here.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.506
All right.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.390
What is it?

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.826
Please help Prince Gyeongseong.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.236
Help Prince Gyeongseong?

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.346
How could I when he went
against the King's order?

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.456
I know that you hold a grudge against.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.896
Prince Gyeongseong from the past.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.930
But you are still asking me that?

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.246
Please let Prince Gyeongseong live.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.530
I beg you.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.660
I see you truly love him.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.176
I am sorry, but I do not have the power.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.130
If you let him live, I will do anything.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:38.416
What are you planning to do
with Prince Gyeongseong?

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.290
<i>Please execute him immediately!</i>

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.536
<i>- Your Majesty!</i>
- What do you think?

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.466
- I actually have a brilliant idea.
<i>- Please execute him immediately!</i>

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.676
Brilliant idea?

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.286
China is having trouble
with barbarians at the border.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.676
Send Prince Gyeongseong there
to suppress the barbarians

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.536
and let him bring the Emperor's edict.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.706
Are you saying send
Prince Gyeongseong to the border?

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.016
That is correct.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.126
If we solve China's headache,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:17.790
I am sure we can get
the Emperor's attention.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:25.366
We struggled for a long time
to eradicate those barbarians,

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.856
but I heard none of the generals
made it back alive.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.356
I am sure Prince Gyeongseong
will easily defeat the barbarians

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.170
and bring back the edict as well.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.846
Not only would it allow
Prince Gyeongseong to repent,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.250
it is a great chance to

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.550
bring honor to the country.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.120
Summon Prince Gyeongseong.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.910
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:13.396
<i>Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.</i>

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.916
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:25.656
<i>Your Majesty, please execute
Prince Gyeongseong immediately.</i>

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.090
<i>Please execute him immediately.</i>

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.890
<i>What is it regarding?</i>

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.980
I learned that

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.980
my father is a member of the Heuksa Clan.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.720
I might

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:14.930
feel too ashamed to face you again.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.440
Beon

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.600
please forgive me.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.080
This is no one's fault.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.130
No matter what happens,

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.430
I will not blame you.

00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:47.112
When I consider what happened yesterday,

00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:50.342
punishing you by death will not be enough.

00:43:50.366 --> 00:43:52.202
But considering our bond,

00:43:52.226 --> 00:43:55.926
I want to give you a last chance
to redeem yourself.

00:43:57.706 --> 00:44:00.292
Go to the border.

00:44:00.316 --> 00:44:04.602
Kill the barbarian general
who is giving China trouble

00:44:04.626 --> 00:44:07.182
and achieve great success.

00:44:07.206 --> 00:44:10.946
Leave before sunrise tomorrow.

00:44:13.896 --> 00:44:16.136
I will follow your order.

00:44:17.476 --> 00:44:19.582
Your Majesty,

00:44:19.606 --> 00:44:23.626
lastly, there is something
I need to tell you.

00:44:25.206 --> 00:44:27.116
Please

00:44:28.236 --> 00:44:30.426
beware of Prince Seonghyeon.

00:44:35.566 --> 00:44:38.152
I trusted you, but you betrayed me.

00:44:38.176 --> 00:44:42.586
Prince Seonghyeon demonstrated
his loyalty toward me in action.

00:44:43.726 --> 00:44:45.826
I hope you do the same.

00:44:53.586 --> 00:44:56.206
Be healthy and well, Your Majesty.

00:45:14.756 --> 00:45:16.796
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:45:31.756 --> 00:45:37.702
They immediately started appealing
as if they had prepared already.

00:45:37.726 --> 00:45:42.166
I am sorry I cannot help you much.

00:45:43.526 --> 00:45:45.202
Do not worry.

00:45:45.226 --> 00:45:46.692
Brother-in-law!

00:45:46.716 --> 00:45:47.992
Brother-in-law,

00:45:48.016 --> 00:45:50.646
I thought I would never see you again.

00:45:52.506 --> 00:45:55.972
How about you rest at our house

00:45:55.996 --> 00:45:58.612
for a few days to rejuvenate?

00:45:58.636 --> 00:46:00.412
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:46:00.436 --> 00:46:02.102
Don't be alone.

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.566
I am afraid I cannot.

00:46:05.566 --> 00:46:06.886
Pardon?

00:46:07.956 --> 00:46:12.262
I am being sent to the border
for a battle tomorrow.

00:46:12.286 --> 00:46:15.186
A battle?

00:46:20.376 --> 00:46:22.792
I need to prepare for the battle now.

00:46:22.816 --> 00:46:23.932
No!

00:46:23.956 --> 00:46:25.422
- Brother-in-law.
- No...

00:46:25.446 --> 00:46:27.586
No, Brother-in-law.

00:46:28.506 --> 00:46:30.846
No...

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:02.032
Why did you make such a suggestion?

00:47:02.056 --> 00:47:05.032
It was a great chance to
eliminate him immediately.

00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:07.812
Do you think the hit list incident

00:47:07.836 --> 00:47:11.296
could have eliminated Prince Gyeongseong?

00:47:12.726 --> 00:47:15.856
This is definitely the
right way to handle him.

00:47:17.876 --> 00:47:20.616
Do not worry.

00:47:22.226 --> 00:47:24.826
The path Prince Gyeongseong is on

00:47:26.296 --> 00:47:29.216
will not bring him back alive.

00:48:13.256 --> 00:48:15.126
<i>Prince Gyeongseong!</i>

00:48:23.956 --> 00:48:26.102
If you leave me behind,

00:48:26.126 --> 00:48:29.646
you won't go 10 ri
without getting sore feet.

00:49:28.316 --> 00:49:31.982
It is so hard to marry you.

00:49:32.006 --> 00:49:35.376
We should've done this
from the get-go, right?

00:49:40.156 --> 00:49:43.422
I might not be able to return.

00:49:43.446 --> 00:49:45.822
Don't say stuff like that.

00:49:45.846 --> 00:49:49.576
What happened to the
obsessive tyrant I know?

00:49:51.506 --> 00:49:54.532
Like how you pursued me relentlessly,

00:49:54.556 --> 00:49:57.096
come back to me.

00:50:02.746 --> 00:50:04.336
I ended up

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:08.022
becoming a source of trouble for you.

00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:10.146
What do you mean, trouble?

00:50:10.856 --> 00:50:14.346
We are one from now on.

00:50:15.676 --> 00:50:17.686
Just like this ring.

00:50:28.126 --> 00:50:30.056
Put it on me, too.

00:50:31.056 --> 00:50:34.936
We need to become a married
couple before the sun rises.

00:50:47.366 --> 00:50:49.136
How pretty.

00:50:51.486 --> 00:50:56.062
This makes us a married couple.

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.846
Bang, bang, bang.

00:51:02.406 --> 00:51:04.626
I cannot believe it.

00:51:06.316 --> 00:51:07.402
It feels like a dream.

00:51:07.426 --> 00:51:09.966
Should I make it feel real for you?

00:51:12.026 --> 00:51:13.922
I, Cha Sun Chaek,

00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:18.976
promise undying love
to Prince Gyeongseong, Yi Beon.

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:32.586
Let me hear from the groom, too.

00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:41.146
My time, that was passing by meaninglessly,

00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:45.706
you are the only one who gave it meaning.

00:51:47.626 --> 00:51:49.136
The first and

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:52.696
the last woman of Yi Beon's life is...

00:51:53.846 --> 00:51:55.536
Cha Sun Chaek.

00:51:56.676 --> 00:51:58.346
Only you.

00:51:59.786 --> 00:52:05.442
<i>♫ Even under the moonlight ♫</i>

00:52:05.466 --> 00:52:10.756
<i>♫ You are all I can see ♫</i>

00:52:12.506 --> 00:52:16.002
<i>♫ I look at no one but you ♫</i>

00:52:16.026 --> 00:52:19.472
<i>♫ I love no one but you ♫</i>

00:52:19.496 --> 00:52:25.712
<i>♫ I am by your side every day ♫</i>

00:52:25.736 --> 00:52:33.302
<i>♫ Your smile is as warm as sunlight ♫</i>

00:52:33.326 --> 00:52:41.326
<i>♫ I fill my every day with you ♫</i>

00:53:13.126 --> 00:53:15.226
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:53:17.186 --> 00:53:18.662
My Lord.

00:53:18.686 --> 00:53:19.686
Yes...

00:53:21.506 --> 00:53:23.656
Return safely.

00:53:29.886 --> 00:53:33.416
Have a safe trip. Come back soon.

00:53:37.726 --> 00:53:40.016
I'll be right here!

00:53:40.706 --> 00:53:43.096
Bye!

00:53:45.316 --> 00:53:47.232
Do not worry so much.

00:53:47.256 --> 00:53:49.636
He will return safely.

00:53:54.346 --> 00:53:55.686
My Lady.

00:53:56.356 --> 00:53:58.826
Prince Gyeongseong is...

00:54:17.726 --> 00:54:20.036
[I will never leave you.
[Be careful, Prince Gyeongseong.]

00:54:22.596 --> 00:54:24.516
I knew you would be like this.

00:54:36.966 --> 00:54:39.276
Do not cry because I am gone.

00:54:49.836 --> 00:54:51.506
Right.

00:54:56.396 --> 00:54:59.326
I will always be with you.

00:55:00.886 --> 00:55:02.816
Come back soon.

00:55:07.826 --> 00:55:09.556
I will be back.

00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:24.396
Don't cry, My Lady.

00:55:30.046 --> 00:55:32.086
My Lady.

00:55:32.856 --> 00:55:35.026
Don't cry

00:56:07.396 --> 00:56:09.712
I shouldn't be sitting here like this.

00:56:09.736 --> 00:56:11.382
Bang Wool.

00:56:11.406 --> 00:56:13.226
Yes, My Lady.

00:56:18.836 --> 00:56:20.822
Could you help me pack?

00:56:20.846 --> 00:56:23.516
Pack? What for?

00:56:26.146 --> 00:56:27.832
I will move into Hoseondang.

00:56:27.856 --> 00:56:30.492
You are suddenly moving into Hoseondang?

00:56:30.516 --> 00:56:32.662
Actually...

00:56:32.686 --> 00:56:36.366
Prince Gyeongseong and
I had a wedding last night.

00:56:37.086 --> 00:56:38.126
Pardon?

00:56:38.816 --> 00:56:41.932
Pardon? Why all of a sudden...

00:56:41.956 --> 00:56:43.852
It just happened so.

00:56:43.876 --> 00:56:46.022
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you, Bang Wool.

00:56:46.046 --> 00:56:48.256
My Lady.

00:56:57.376 --> 00:56:59.326
It is all right.

00:57:00.126 --> 00:57:02.872
It is too late, but
congratulations, My Lady.

00:57:02.896 --> 00:57:07.086
I should call you Madam, not Lady now.

00:57:08.176 --> 00:57:12.006
<i>Madam? What are you talking about?</i>

00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:19.962
Mother and Father.

00:57:19.986 --> 00:57:23.012
Without your approval,

00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:25.856
we had a wedding, just the two of us.

00:57:26.886 --> 00:57:28.826
I'm sorry.

00:57:29.716 --> 00:57:33.482
I'm now Prince Gyeongseong's wife.

00:57:33.506 --> 00:57:36.426
Yes, I'm glad you did.

00:57:37.526 --> 00:57:41.002
Goodness. You are so
delicate. How could you live alone

00:57:41.026 --> 00:57:44.032
in that huge house without a husband?

00:57:44.056 --> 00:57:48.596
That's why I should keep the house company.

00:57:49.296 --> 00:57:50.982
Don't worry, Father.

00:57:51.006 --> 00:57:54.402
No, Sun Chaek. I will come with you.

00:57:54.426 --> 00:57:55.912
Do not be like that, Your Excellency.

00:57:55.936 --> 00:57:57.152
I will go with her.

00:57:57.176 --> 00:57:59.442
You cannot. You cannot go alone.

00:57:59.466 --> 00:58:00.942
- Come on.
- Let go.

00:58:00.966 --> 00:58:03.116
What are you doing?

00:58:08.686 --> 00:58:10.062
If you have decided,

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:13.372
get ready to move to Hoseondang.

00:58:13.396 --> 00:58:15.912
I will bring my belongings. Wait here.

00:58:15.936 --> 00:58:17.732
What are you doing, Your Excellency?

00:58:17.756 --> 00:58:20.102
I will go with her.

00:58:20.126 --> 00:58:21.926
Aigoo, Your Excellency.

00:58:46.166 --> 00:58:47.636
There.

00:58:59.496 --> 00:59:02.842
Your moving cart must be here already.

00:59:02.866 --> 00:59:05.496
Let me check. Just one moment.

00:59:35.066 --> 00:59:36.806
This is...

01:00:36.096 --> 01:00:37.546
<i>It's the enemy!</i>

01:00:43.796 --> 01:00:45.436
Shield!

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:21.256

<i>Prince Gyeongseong,
even though we are apart,</i>

01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:51.862
<i>I can sense you where I am.</i>

01:01:51.886 --> 01:01:55.382
<i>Everything ends when
you reach the conclusion.</i>

01:01:55.406 --> 01:01:57.452
<i>I fear that</i>

01:01:57.476 --> 01:02:01.916
<i>my lover will be sad

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.562

<i>You just need to accept me!</i>

01:02:10.616 --> 01:02:13.342
<i>Does it mean we switched bodies?</i>

01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:16.512

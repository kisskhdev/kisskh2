00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.319
We graduated!

(Year 2021)

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.239
After today,

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.040
we will be

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.439
officially graduated.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.480
Come.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.519
Let's take a picture together.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.560
We graduated!

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.280
Su Beilu,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.479
please report
to the HR department next Monday.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.759
What does it mean?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.520
Are you a fool?

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.039
You are hired!

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:18.520
Me?

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.439
I've been hired?

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.879
You found a job!

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.360
I found a job!

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.080
Yes!

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.400
I found a job!

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.080
I found a job!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.560
I'm the only one without a job now.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.120
It's fine.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.000
I can transfer my luck to you.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.039
Get ready!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.560
Wait.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.520
Congratulations.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.199
I...

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.680
I am hired too!

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.599
We are colleagues!

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.879
Colleagues!

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.479
We are colleagues!

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.120
Thank you.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.260
If you hadn't brought be
to interview at Chongle Hospital,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.830
I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.919
We will surely cherish it,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.599
right?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.400
You're welcome!

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.199
We are buddies, after all!

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.919
Come on.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.919
Give me a hug!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.360
Give me a hug!

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.560
My son!

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.800
Mom!

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.080
You are my pride.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.479
Here.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.080
Flowers.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.199
Mom.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.960
You must feel hot.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.759
When I make money,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.879
I will surely buy you

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.960
delicious food,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.340
warm clothes, and useful things.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.479
Silly Child.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.159
I just want you to be healthy,

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.159
safe and happy.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:30.520
Mrs. Chun.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.439
Here.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.000
It's yours.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.360
I have one too?

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.639
Of course.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.759
From now on,

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.080
both of you must help each other

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.560
to strive forward steadfastly

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.639
on the path of medicine to become a respected,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.599
benevolent, and compassionate doctor.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.759
Mom.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.360
College of Veterinary Medicine.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.240
We are learning to become a veterinary.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.080
We don't treat people.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.199
You are still doctors.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.960
They are all lives.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.759
Right, Beilu?

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.560
Come. Let me take a photo for both of you.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.240
Come.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.000
Sure.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.360
One, two, three.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.360
Great.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.280
Let's take a photo together.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.719
One, two, three.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.840
Help me and my son take a photo.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.479
All right.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.319
Come on.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.080
Come.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.620
(Year 2017)

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:25.720
Hurry.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.820
The teacher is coming soon.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.240
Why is this so high?

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.000
Hurry up.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.279
Hua is giving birth.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.879
Hurry!

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.319
Hurry!

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.000
Wait for me.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.759
I told you to jump down
using that as a cushion

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.720
but you just had to jump down directly.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.040
I'm afraid of heights.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.199
I didn't even dare look down.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.591
I think I sprained my ankle.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.600
Seriously.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:51.800
We said

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.439
we'd witness Hua give birth to puppies.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.160
In your condition,
should we get you treated or go see Hua?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.720
Why don't...

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.279
Why don't you leave me here

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.360
and go alone?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.800
Go on.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.680
Go.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.879
Come on.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.920
I'll carry you.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.040
Get up.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.399
Where are we going?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600
Going to the front door?

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.240
If you go to the front door,
we'll be scolded.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.439
Whatever.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.879
Just tell them
I was the one who told you to jump.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.820
(Year 2007)

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.879
What...

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.759
What do you want to do?

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.879
Do you see what's on Long?

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.720
There's a grain of rice

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.000
on his face.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.160
We are talking about his arm.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.600
Su Beilu,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.480
show him!

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.639
(Is this the real Su Beilu?)

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.439
Green Dragon on the left.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.920
White Tiger on the right.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.079
Do you know how great I am know?

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.839
What should you call me?

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.040
Long...

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.560
Goodie Long!

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.079
- Granny!
- Goodie Long!

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.959
Goodie Long.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.279
I finally found you.
Come home with me quickly.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.820
Otherwise, your father will beat you up.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.839
All of you should go back too.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.560
- No.
- Go back.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.360
No!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.439
No.

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.240
Listen to me.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.800
Good boy.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.800
I'm not going back.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.620
If you don't go back,
what if your father beats you?

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.360
No!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.240
Listen to me.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.000
Good boy.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.839
No!

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.079
- No!
- Listen to me.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.120
You scared me.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120
I was so scared.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.120
Let me out!

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:43.839
Open the door!

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.680
Let me out!

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.639
Hey!

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.639
Can you not open the door?

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.879
Hey,

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.600
you need to calm down.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.759
I want my mom!

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.879
I don't want to be calm!

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.560
If you don't stay calm, I'm leaving.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.000
Don't!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I'll stop knocking, all right?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.600
Go to the window first.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.720
You tried to open from the inside
but it didn't work, right?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.839
I did.

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:14.720
It didn't work.

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.240
That means
it is locked from the outside.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.360
Do you have a piece of card that's hard?

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:21.839
What are you trying to do?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.639
Open the lock and save you.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.600
I learned it from the movies.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.319
This is the hardest one I have.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:39.000
Hurry!

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.480
It really works!

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.000
The movie doesn't lie.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.480
Thank you.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.360
You are my savior.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.920
I broke your card.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.360
It's fine.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.120
Let's go home together.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.360
That's right.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.879
Your name is Su Beilu, right?

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.040
I am Chun Ge.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.279
Chun Ge?

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.839
Your name is so weird.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.079
(Su Beilu is Su Beilu.)

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.600
(He is indeed unrelated to Qin.)

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.920
(Whatever. I should watch everything.)

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.140
(Year 2006)

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.560
Chen!

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.730
Give me a bottle of soy sauce.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.120
Please wait.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.919
Two yuan.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.080
Put it on my tab.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.480
Your granny knows what to do.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.290
Where's your granny?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.519
She went to take stock.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.639
She's not back yet?

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.080
I guess she didn't catch the bus.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.799
If she hasn't returned by tonight

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:48.720
and you feel hungry,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.960
come and eat at my place.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.799
Are you alone as well?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.240
Celebrate my birthday with me, then.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.279
I made a puppy for myself.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.799
Now that I have you with me,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.480
I'll give you this puppy.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.279
What is your name?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.080
I don't think you have a name.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:13.200
I'll call you Yellow.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:15.960
When Granny comes back,
we'll have delicious food.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.399
I'll share some with you.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.260
(Year 2005)

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.600
(I was here before.)

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.720
(What does Su Beilu
have to do with this?)

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.919
(This is bad.)

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:59.240
(I'll meet myself from the past.)

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.279
Is the person inside all right?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.200
Is anyone alive?

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:26.320
How are you?

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.919
He's dying.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.679
Come on.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.799
Don't fall asleep.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.279
Someone will come and save you.

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:33.720
Hurry.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.279
(Su Beilu was the child
I rescued many years ago?)

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.120
(Su Beilu's resemblance to Qin
is just a coincidence.)

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:31.720
(What am I)

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:34.399
(actually hoping for?)

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:34.480
It's raining so heavily.
Why are you here?

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.480
Can you first
let me come inside for shelter?

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:39.360
Thank you.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.020
(Yashe)

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.799
That's right.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.279
I'm returning this to you.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.200
Why are you giving me money?

00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:00.519
I was chased out by my landlady.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.900
She returned me my deposit
so I can return the money to you.

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:04.330
You got chased out by your landlady?

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:05.720
Why?

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.120
Because of it.

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:10.360
Don't be afraid.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.279
It is just a puppy.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.010
The landlady chased me out

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.990
because she found out
that I was keeping a puppy.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.799
Why are you keeping a dog?

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.399
Its owner brought it
to the hospital for treatment.

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.279
(Chongle Pet Hospital)
What are you doing? Give it to me.

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:27.960
Move!

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.320
X-ray doesn't lie!
There's bone callus formation.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.120
That means it's an old injury.
It wasn't hit by a car.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.000
It was beaten by you!

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.799
Nonsense!

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:34.720
I didn't!

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.840
Move!

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:38.360
He hit me!

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.240
Everyone saw it!

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.279
He hit me!

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.360
Manager, he was lying!

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.279
Move!

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.360
He hit me!

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.600
I'm going to report all of you!

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.159
Go on.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.000
Dog Torturer!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.750
Apologize to him first.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.240
No!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:47.950
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.600
Many people are watching.
Apologize to him first.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.080
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Su Beilu!

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:54.679
I exposed him
for torturing a dog in public.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.279
Later,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.720
the manager fired me.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.919
Next, I adopted it

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.360
and gave it a name, Tuanzi.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.080
I saved a life.

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:07.480
It's worth it to be fired
because of you, Tuanzi.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:07.879
Here.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.679
Eat more.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.879
You are quite optimistic.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.039
I'm already used to it.

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:16.840
Whenever I am late,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.000
my superior will be early.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.960
When I try to dry my blanket,
it starts raining.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.320
When I change to another line
while queuing up,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.759
the original line goes faster.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.840
There's one more thing

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.440
that I haven't told you.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.159
When I was young,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.679
my parents passed away.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.440
I was raised by my granny.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.759
A few years ago, she passed away as well.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.279
You said I had a good attitude,

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:41.480
but if I don't

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:44.679
live optimistically,

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:47.039
I would never live at all.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.840
Bad days will eventually pass.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.559
You are so strong and optimistic.

00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:56.320
It'll surely get better.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.240
Have some hot water.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.160
I think the rain has stopped.

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:19.440
We'll head back first.

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.850
Thank you for your hot water
and your encouragement.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.039
Tuanzi,

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:24.320
let's go.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.840
Bye.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.360
Why don't you stay a night here?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.679
I have a bed here.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.240
It's fine.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.799
I promised my friend.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.120
You will catch a cold
when you're drenched like this.

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:41.960
Your dog, too.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:50.200
Let me get you a blanket and a towel.

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:55.480
I feel really bad about troubling you.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.360
Thank you.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.039
Tuanzi,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.240
let's sleep here tonight. All right?

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:14.680
You are right.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.839
Life will be better.

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:17.799
See?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.599
It's already better.

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:21.200
That's right.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.799
Can I charge my device anywhere?

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.000
My phone is dead.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.680
Can you help me

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.440
charge my phone?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.359
Give it to me.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:33.640
Thank you.

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:41.000
My little Tuanzi.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:47.400
Rest early.

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:49.359
Good night.

00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:52.160
Good night.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.960
Are you full?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.039
Do you want to eat more?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.140
(Yashe)

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.200
(Thank you for last night.)

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.440
(Tuanzi and I will leave first.)

00:18:43.599 --> 00:18:45.640
(The breakfast
is my payment for my stay.)

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.880
Hello.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.119
I'm the owner of this phone.

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:17.440
Did you pick up my phone?

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.119
Where are you?

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:19.390
I'll come and get it from you right away.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:21.079
It's me, Bizhi.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.440
I left my phone
charging at your place last night.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.079
That's great.

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:27.279
I thought I lost my phone.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.759
Can you deliver my phone to me?

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.200
Where are you?

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:33.960
My address is...

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.000
If you take a taxi,
you need to go to the junction and...

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.160
Yellow, let me see
if your eyes are getting better.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.119
We just need to put some eye drops

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.480
and you'll almost be fine.

00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:50.359
Good boy.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.839
Let me see

00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:54.000
if you have any ear mites.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.480
Looks good over here.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.680
Let's look at your other ear.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:01.279
No ear mites over here too.

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:03.079
Here.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.920
Drink this.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.400
Hello.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.400
Hello.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:10.279
Are you here to adopt or donate?

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.519
I'm here to see him.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.759
Dr. Su?

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.000
He usually runs free clinics here.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.920
Look at my adoption center.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.000
It's not for profit.

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:22.190
We are only depending
on the donation of kind people.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.279
Moreover, Dr. Su's salary isn't high.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.400
I heard he even lost his job recently.

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:28.559
But these dog food

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.319
and medicine

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:31.440
for cats and dogs

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.880
were all provided by Dr. Su.

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:34.440
He's such a good kid.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.359
Bizhi!

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.690
I'll leave you two alone.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.200
Thank you.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.839
You're welcome.

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:44.599
I'm sorry for troubling you to come here.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.960
Thank you.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.519
Come in.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.480
There's no need.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.160
Do you

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.839
plan to work here in the future?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.359
This place is good.

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:02.720
Besides, this is
the only thing I'm good at.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.359
But this job doesn't pay.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:05.500
How do you plan to survive?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.759
For some reason, the nearby pet shops
haven't been hiring recently.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.480
I saw recruitment notices
on the internet.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.370
I called them
and they said they were hiring,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.160
but after I submitted by details,

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.680
they said they weren't hiring anymore.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.980
When are we going back
to the past again?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.190
I've been quite free recently.

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:24.599
Perhaps I can still remember something.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.500
You don't need to do this anymore.

00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:32.599
You are not him.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.279
You know everything?

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:47.440
I'm just curious.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.690
I want to go back
to the past to have fun.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.960
Sorry.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.440
Am I prohibited

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.440
from going to Yashe anymore?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.240
No.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:05.440
You must come every day.

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:08.000
I'm planning to give you a job

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.799
as an assistant at Yashe.

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:12.680
Are you interested?

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:14.079
Yes!

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:15.920
Do I help you sell antiques?

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.920
Does selling antiques
make a lot of money?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.960
But I'm bad at history.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.119
I'm a science student.

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:21.480
Moreover, I have low EQ.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.519
I might offend customers.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.640
That was how I lost my previous job.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:26.599
But you don't have a phone.

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:27.960
Why don't I buy one for you, Bizhi?

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:28.759
Oh,

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:29.839
I can't call you Bizhi.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:31.240
You are my boss now.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.390
I'll call you Mister from now on.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.240
Is that fine, Mister?

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.599
I regret it a little now.

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.119
Let me consider it.

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:37.240
Don't regret it!

00:22:37.519 --> 00:22:38.680
I'll surely do my best!

00:22:38.759 --> 00:22:40.400
I'll let every customer feel like home!

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.230
Tomorrow at ten in the morning.
Don't be late.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.640
All right!

00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:43.839
Ten in the morning!

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:44.839
I'll be punctual!

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:47.640
Yellow!

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.119
I found a job!

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:52.319
(Home of Love)
What do you want to eat?

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:53.480
Ice cream.

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:54.680
Ice cream!

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:55.359
All right!

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:56.370
I'll buy for all of you!

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.759
Welcome to Yashe.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.799
(Welcome)
I'm your guide, Su Beilu.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.000
(Welcome)
If you need anything,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.480
you can ask me about it.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:13.440
What are you doing?

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:15.319
What is this you're wearing?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.680
What do you think?
I asked them for an expedited delivery.

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:19.559
Take it off.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.279
Take it off now!

00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:24.799
You are my boss.

00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:26.079
You call the shots.

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:34.680
Anyone?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.799
Welcome.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.240
Master Dong?

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.119
You, again?

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.359
Are you surprised?

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.680
I'm an official employee of Yashe now.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.599
You are an employee?

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:47.079
Wait...

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:49.759
With your quality,

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.359
can you even become an employee here?

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.599
I graduate
with a bachelor's degree after all.

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:55.400
Fine.

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:57.803
Let me give you a test.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.720
Take this chair, for example.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.039
Tell me about this chair's material,

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:04.759
workmanship,

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:05.759
and era.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.640
Explain it to me.

00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:11.680
Today is his first day at work.
He doesn't know anything.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.599
Master Dong, please forgive him.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.359
Mister,

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:17.279
I was just fooling around with him.

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:20.799
Where's the floor cleaner?

00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:29.480
This place is huge.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.519
Is this a warehouse?

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:44.680
Don't move.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.160
You are not allowed to enter this room.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.880
I...

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:53.599
I'm finding a cleaner for Xuanwu.

00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:55.119
I thought this was the warehouse.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.799
This is not a warehouse.

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.720
Anyway, you are not supposed

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:00.079
to enter this room.

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.039
Yes.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.519
Sorry.

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:06.359
Follow me.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.000
There's also a yard here?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.240
I've always wanted a yard
since I was young

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.680
so I can bathe in the sun
and keep a dog.

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:21.160
Read this.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.140
(5,000 Years of China)

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.119
Are you scolding me?

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.200
Studying requires
a step-by-step approach.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.610
Then, you won't be in trouble when you
deal with customers like Master Dong.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.799
Study well.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.820
(5,000 Years of China)

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.200
What are you doing?

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:52.480
Wake up and go to work.

00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:55.720
There are no customers.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.160
Do you think it's easy to make money?

00:25:58.279 --> 00:25:59.839
Your work isn't just to watch the shop.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:03.559
Work is here.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.240
You talk a lot.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.119
Follow me.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.200
Your remote control has three rings.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.440
What does this mean?

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:22.480
Time, location,
and geographical position.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.839
How do you use it?

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:24.599
Teach me.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.240
You don't need to know.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.079
When we go, you must...

00:26:38.079 --> 00:26:38.640
I know.

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:39.920
Three promises.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:40.880
One,

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.039
don't run around.

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:42.680
Two,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.640
don't shout.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.759
Three, don't disturb
the lives of ancient people.

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:46.960
I remember everything.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.519
There's also the most important thing.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.880
Don't change other people's fate?

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:55.960
It's be careful.

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:57.480
Safety first.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.480
Understood.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.839
Let's go!

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.880
Are you sure
the coordinates are correct?

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.079
Who's staying here?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.440
We even have to come here at night.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.599
I'm sure it's here.

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.039
Do you...

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.559
Do you feel

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:39.799
it's getting emptier

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.559
and creepier?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.599
Are you sure this is the place?

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:48.559
I think

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.920
it's this place.

00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:56.039
Why don't you confirm it again?

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.440
Liuqing Comb.

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.359
Gu Huaijin.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.400
We need to walk ten li southeast

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.920
from this bamboo forest.

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:20.559
Gu Huaijin's grave?

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.680
Ghost!

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.400
Su Beilu.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.240
Come back, Su Beilu!

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.799
Wait for me!

00:28:30.319 --> 00:28:31.119
Su Beilu!

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:35.880
Madam,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.640
we are leaving.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.359
Sure.

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:38.039
Take care.

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:39.440
Why are you running?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.559
Both of us went there
without doing anything wrong.

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:44.400
Why did you run?

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.960
I am the boss and I didn't even run.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.640
Why did you run?

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.160
No.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.559
You asked me to go after the general,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.570
save someone
from jumping down a building,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.440
or go into a fire and that's fine.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.680
But you didn't tell me
there were ghost stories

00:28:57.079 --> 00:28:58.359
among the missions.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.500
There aren't any ghosts!

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.000
There are no ghosts!

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.319
How are there ghosts
in this time and age?

00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:03.650
We are going to search for clues.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.640
That is a grave.

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:09.000
Tianguang Market's Little Ancestor
is never wrong.

00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:10.680
You were startled

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.759
and made me find nothing.

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:13.559
That was a dead person.

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:15.799
Tailor Du, you're here.

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:16.160
I'm here.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.880
The same?

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.599
Yes. The same.

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:18.079
Sure.

00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:18.720
Keep the money.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.160
All right.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.839
Come back again.

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:20.480
Sure.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:22.720
Madam,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.440
I'm leaving.

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:24.880
Zhang, you're done?

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:25.839
Sure.

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:26.920
Come back again.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.279
Madam.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:31.039
How long have you been opened?

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.079
Probably

00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:33.079
15 or 16 years.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.400
Can I ask you about someone?

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.640
Sure.

00:29:37.319 --> 00:29:39.160
Her name is Gu Huaijin.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.519
She's also from Qinghe City.

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:42.880
Why are you asking about her?

00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:47.580
It's useless to ask like this.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:50.039
Madam, give me a basket of meatbuns.

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:53.039
A basket?

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.240
A whole basket.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.680
Coming!

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.960
A whole basket.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.240
What a big basket.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.680
Can you finish them all?
Don't waste them.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:05.480
Madam,

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:06.920
look.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.440
We've bought so many meatbuns.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.920
Just tell us something.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:13.559
Hold on.

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:15.240
What are you both doing?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.880
We write storybooks.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:20.720
We just want to write
about Gu Huaijin's story.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.319
That's right.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.160
Well,

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.920
I can reveal something.

00:30:30.599 --> 00:30:32.519
What happened to the Gu family back then

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.839
was too cruel.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.559
Gu Huaijin was the daughter
of the escort leader, Gu Xuantong.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.921
The Gu family went everywhere
without failing their missions.

00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:45.839
However, during an escort mission,

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.880
she was killed by bandits.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.359
Only the young master,

00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:51.319
Gu Bingyu was left in the family.

00:30:51.319 --> 00:30:55.660
(Escort Agency Gu)

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.359
Both of you are...

00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:06.200
We are businessmen from a foreign land
and are drawn by this place's fame.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.990
We are looking for
Young Master Gu Bingyu.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.680
May I know

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:09.799
if he's in?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.359
Young Master went on an escort mission.

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:13.279
He won't be back for some time.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.000
Both of you,

00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:15.359
please come back again.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.319
Why are both of you

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.200
(Pu Jingtang)

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.359
looking for Young Master Gu?

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.440
We have some items

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:24.799
to show Young Master Gu.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.160
It's fine.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.359
We will come back another day.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.300
(Escort Agency Gu)

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.740
(Gu Bingyu)

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.119
Everyone,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.039
let's rest up.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.079
Peng.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.720
Leader.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.720
I'm not familiar with the routes here.

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:11.000
I want to scout ahead.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.880
I'll leave the goods

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.920
in your care.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.400
Sure.

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:15.039
No problem.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.400
Don't worry, Leader.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.599
Master Peng.

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:25.119
Have a pastry.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:25.839
Yes.

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:35.799
Si!

00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:37.480
Si!

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:41.599
The wine from the post house just now

00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:42.359
must be poisoned.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.599
Si!

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.640
Si!

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:49.119
Er!

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:51.880
San!

00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:37.160
Stop, all of you!

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:37.839
Don't move!

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.400
It seems like

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.039
you are prepared.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:43.279
Tell us who your employer is.

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:44.640
I'll spare you.

00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:46.319
Do whatever you want

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.920
with me!

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.200
Get up!

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.359
Why is there a woman?

00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:01.799
Leader, what should we do with them?

00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:07.839
Release them.

00:34:07.839 --> 00:34:08.760
Release them?

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.480
Why?

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:10.239
- We're just releasing them?
- We're just releasing them?

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.239
Release them!

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.199
Get lost!

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:15.679
Get lost!

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.519
I don't understand.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.199
Since you killed some of them,

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.960
why did you leave some alive?

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:36.400
If they are just a few ordinary bandits,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.760
we don't have to worry.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.920
However,
these people pretend to be bandits

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.199
yet they act like our peers.

00:34:43.519 --> 00:34:44.679
Peng, think about it.

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:45.920
Bribing post houses

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.119
isn't something
that ordinary bandits are capable of.

00:34:50.519 --> 00:34:51.400
So, I'm sure

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.519
the robbery

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.519
must be organized
by another escort agency.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.599
So, not only are we sparing their lives

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.719
to relay the information

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.639
but also to warn them?

00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:03.400
That's right.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.159
We need to show them

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:09.320
that the Gu family of Qinghe City
isn't as declined as they imagined.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.760
Everyone who offends us

00:35:13.159 --> 00:35:14.519
will be killed.

00:35:14.519 --> 00:35:15.140
(Escort Agency Gu)

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:47.800
My sister was dead for three years

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.840
and you've played the zither here
for three years.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.119
That person is gone.

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:55.920
Meeting and separation is fleeting.

00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:58.559
Life and death is like an illusion.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.400
Why do you...

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:07.239
I came back from an escort

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:08.519
I'm tired.

00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:11.039
You should rest early, Pu.

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:16.880
The magnolias are blooming again.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.760
It's Huaijin's

00:36:22.159 --> 00:36:23.519
favorite season again.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.800
For the outer strings one and two,
use a light strum

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:53.199
or a heavy plucking.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.559
For the inner strings six and seven,
use a light stroke

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.639
or a heavy...

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.599
Huaijin.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.159
(Gu Huaijin)

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:06.320
Can you

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.480
be calm for a moment?

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.400
I'm quite calm.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.199
I'm calmly
listening to you play the zither

00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:14.119
and calmly practicing my swordsmanship.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.230
Your father asked me
to teach you how to play zither

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.800
just to calm your temper

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:19.800
and be elegant.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.960
My father asked you to teach me these

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:24.199
for noble reasons

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.360
but in truth,

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.719
he just wants
to raise an obedient sheep.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.639
When I'm at the age of marriage,

00:37:30.646 --> 00:37:33.320
he will marry me to a good family
to serve other people's parents,

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.639
my husband and teach my children.

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:36.920
But that's not what I want.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.880
I don't want to become
an obedient livestock.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.960
What do you want?

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.199
I want to become a fit eagle

00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:47.400
to roam the martial world.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:49.360
I don't want to become somebody's wife.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.440
Pu Jingtang,

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.679
do you want me
to become someone else's wife?

00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:35.679
Your lesson today isn't over yet.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.400
That's enough.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.320
Stop it, Huaijin.

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:58.400
The escort team
will depart in 15 minutes.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.990
Whose goods are you escorting today?

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:06.719
I know.

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:09.239
Escort Agency Gu keeps its secrets.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.320
But I already saw it.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.250
You are escorting goods
for the Du residence of Cangzhou, right?

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.960
You are amazing.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.700
You can already lead an escort
for the most noble family in Cangzhou.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.039
Unlike me.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:32.719
Bingyu,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.079
I'm already familiar

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:35.790
with the few moves
you taught me in secret.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.790
When are you
going to teach me the other moves?

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.679
You should

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.000
focus on practicing zither instead.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.719
Jingtang is too nice

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840
and has spoiled you.

00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:45.880
Him?

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.639
Of course, he can't control me.

00:39:54.199 --> 00:39:55.000
Honestly speaking,

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.719
I don't know if it's right or wrong

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.880
to teach you these ways of killing.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.840
What's wrong?

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.480
Did Mother scold you?

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.679
Or have you regretted it?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.519
You are courageous

00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:14.880
and intelligent.

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:16.719
You are way better than me.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.599
We are just a year apart.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.880
Right now,

00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:27.840
you are the face of the Gu family

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:29.960
and the leader of all heroes.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.639
However, I'm just trapped.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.590
The Gu family has never allowed a woman
to be the chief escort.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.239
If I get to decide my own life,

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.880
even if

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:55.360
my life is full of dangers,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.239
I'm still willing to accept it.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.980
Take these sword manuals and scriptures

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:22.559
and study them.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.599
Remember.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.280
Don't let Mother find out.

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:27.559
Sure.

00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:28.950
I'll spar with you when you return.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.159
Thank you, Bingyu.

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:31.400
I promise you.

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:33.060
When you achieved success in learning,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.600
we will run escort missions together.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.719
If you hadn't spoiled Huaijin

00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:51.199
and let her run escort missions,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.000
she wouldn't be dead.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.159
Who ordered you to rob us?

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:09.340
(Late Sister Gu Huaijin's Grave)

00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:28.320
(Huaijin,)

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.000
(no one will force you
to play the zither anymore.)

00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:49.639
Right now,

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.320
you only care
about bringing honor to the ancestors

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.519
and reviving the Gu family.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840
It's all right.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.760
I, Pu Jingtang,

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.880
will avenge Huaijin.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.760
How do you know

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.360
that I won't be taking revenge?

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.140

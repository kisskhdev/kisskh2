"S LINE" (The red thread connecting people who have had sexual relations)

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.729
Seo-ah

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.400
Kang Seo-ah, open your eyes

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.090
Kang Seo-ah

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.820
(Central Operating Room)

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.990
Where's Seo-ah

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.120
Why were you at school at that time

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.560
I went to find Seo-ah

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.250
You went to find her?

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.560
She called me

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.500
Said she was going to school

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.890
Why go to school at that time

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.940
I don't know either

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.330
I’m unclear about the rest

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.310
But Seo-ah...

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.940
Definitely didn't commit suicide

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.260
The language teacher still hasn't come to school?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.329
Call him quickly

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.430
How can he be late on a day like this

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.020
I did call him but he didn’t pick up

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.530
How exactly are you all disciplining the students

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.480
How can something like this happen at school

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.290
If you want to die, just do it at home

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.910
Why choose to jump at school

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.300
Dean of Studies

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.400
Aren't you going too far saying that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.350
And that student is still alive, okay

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.120
Mr. Lee, did you do anything right to say such things

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.579
You are responsible too, okay

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.660
Yes, I am responsible too

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.700
Aren't we all the same?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.150
But why blame the students?

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.940
I didn't blame the students.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.290
You clearly said it's the students' fault.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.560
- I understand Mr. Li's position - Did I say anything wrong?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.940
- Please discuss it with me directly - Mr. Li, stop talking

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.490
This isn't an issue for Mr. Li to pursue

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.080
It's not my responsibility to pursue this with you

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.190
Are you okay?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.190
In any case

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.600
This matter

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.900
Try not to let it spread

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.800
Please keep it confidential, teachers

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.159
He smells like smoke

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.940
Your teeth will turn yellow that way

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.280
Your teeth are so yellow, they're like burnt rice

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.300
Hey

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.130
Why isn't Kim Hye Young at school?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.820
What a coincidence, as soon as Kang Sun Ah fell, she's not coming to school

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.230
Maybe school is too boring, so she doesn't want to come

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.270
I don't know

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.770
Teacher, it's all my fault; it's a student from our class

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.700
It's not your fault

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.520
Isn't she the student who nearly triggered the anti-bullying committee last time?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.660
By the way, the language teacher still isn't answering the phone?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.600
I know, it's odd; he's never done this before

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.330
Ugh, it's so frustrating

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.760
Isn't there any good news?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.010
It's always bullying, suicides, these terrible things

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.840
Mr. Kim

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.830
I'm here.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.830
Didn't you say you were going to propose?

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.380
Have you decided on the wedding date yet?

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.820
I don't plan to get married anymore.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.620
(Apartment)

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.860
Just put it over here.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.500
Yalu, say hello to your uncle.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.770
You should greet people when you see them.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.080
This is for you.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.620
Yalu.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.010
Are you feeling shy?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.900
Is that all your luggage?

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.720
I'm only staying here for a week before leaving.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.070
I've sent the rest of my luggage ahead.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.659
Why are you suddenly going to Canada?

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.980
Leaving behind a perfectly good job, really...

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.940
Have a seat.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.190
This is your first time at my place, right?

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.300
How do you feel about it?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.760
It's quite nice.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.730
You moved here last year, right?

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.080
No, I've been here for over two years now.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.150
Time really flies.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.640
I owe it all to Mr. Kim Byung-chul.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.580
Should I call him brother-in-law?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.950
What did you say?

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.490
I'm staying over; did brother-in-law say anything? Is he okay with it?

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.460
Of course not, you're my brother!

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.530
Besides, he's very busy with his work.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.840
You probably won't have many chances to see each other.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.820
Let me see

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.530
Okay

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.080
You said you'd continue working at the school until you go abroad, right?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.300
Yeah

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.920
Hold on a moment

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.880
Kang Sun-ah

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.530
You might as well get up and yell at me

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:43.570
You're looking for evidence, aren't you?

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.740
Kang Sun-ah

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.220
I know her quite well

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.670
She's not your ordinary tough cookie

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.920
Suicide

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.470
What a joke

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:02.070
And Kim Hye-young, who enjoyed bullying Kang Sun-ah, didn't come to school the day after the incident

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.660
That's highly suspicious too

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.320
Who are you

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.720
I'm Lee Kyung-jin from class five

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.230
Assuming this wasn't suicide but murder

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.100
The most suspicious would be those closest to her

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.230
Because Kang Sun-ah was ostracized

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.290
No

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.730
Thinking back, she recently made some new friends

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.480
She's not dead

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.620
What

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.340
I said Sun-ah is still alive

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.060
Ah... right

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.950
Sorry

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.100
By the way, you're quite familiar with her too

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.420
Where did these glasses come from

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.890
I got them made at the eyewear shop

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.890
When did you get them?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.070
Last year.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.270
Why haven't you worn them before then?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.100
Because wearing contacts makes my eyes uncomfortable.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.390
Teacher.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.650
What's up?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.790
Do you know whose glasses these are?

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.070
Not really sure.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.700
What's going on?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.240
Nothing, just found them at my spot.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.550
Then they must be yours.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.080
Try them on, they seem to suit you.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.850
Okay.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.880
Sorry.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.690
I should have checked in with her earlier.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.460
As the homeroom teacher,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.940
I didn't even know what was on the students' minds.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.900
So do you think she committed suicide?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:03.990
What?

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.080
Currently,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.260
it's not determined as a suicide.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.350
Either way,

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.340
if there's anything I can help with, I will.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.070
Please feel free to let me know.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.130
The student who bullied Sana before,

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.540
are they still at school now?

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.480
That student now...

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.070
Are they missing?

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.410
Yes.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.260
What about this student?

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.900
I found this in Sana's bag.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.720
It seems to be taken on the day it happened.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.750
Are you Lee Ji-won?

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.790
Yes.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.620
I'll just get straight to the point with you.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.080
What's your relationship with Sana?

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.040
We don't have any relationship.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.090
If there's no relationship,

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.240
why would you take photos and go on dates together?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.590
She was the one who asked me out first.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.700
And you agreed just because she asked?

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.640
Yes.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.820
It's just...

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.780
It was interesting.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.610
A person who used to be outcast suddenly changes completely.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.750
I knew she was interested in me.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.790
Was there anything unusual when you were together?

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.270
No.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.740
It was quite normal.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.000
What did you do at the cafe?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.040
Can I be honest?

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.850
We talked a bit and then kissed.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.850
I wanted to take it further,

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.580
but she refused.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.980
Then where did you go?

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.070
Oh right.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.060
After taking photos,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.890
she suddenly ran off like crazy.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.430
She said something was missing.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.810
(Han Ji-uk)

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.020
(Wu Dongshi)

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:10.980
(Sinwu Green Park 2)

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.230
Let's raise a glass, everyone

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.660
Okay

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.890
I'm sorry for suddenly showing up and intruding like this

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:47.760
Oh, come on

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.070
No need to be so formal

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.190
Brother-in-law

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.930
Can I call you brother-in-law?

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.520
Yes, feel free to call me that

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.360
But you know

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.490
You two don't really look alike

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.120
He's way too handsome

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.300
Cheers

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.510
Can I ask you something?

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.270
Sure

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.140
I heard you were about to get married

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.960
Why did you suddenly break up?

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.980
Honey

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.720
Don't ask that

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.670
It's okay, just a moment

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.100
We were living together

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.770
But before the wedding, I saw

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.720
I came home early from work

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.680
And found her in bed with my friend

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.120
This person, no

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.570
Our brother-in-law

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.700
Wow

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.080
You did really well

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.830
It's better to find out such things before the wedding

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.440
That's why people say it's the ancestors' blessing, right?

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.630
I really admire it, truly admire it.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.090
Come on, have a drink.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.100
Alright.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.200
Pour one for me too.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.420
-Is it okay? -Yeah.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.080
The drink is finished.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.900
I'm really
sorry.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.920
It's fine.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.630
It's the work things.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.970
Messages keep coming.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.670
Brother-in-law.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.410
What subject do you teach?

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.170
I teach English.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.390
very nice

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.620
sounds good

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.420
Well, because of my job,

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.560
I often interact with foreigners.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.880
By the way, brother-in-law,

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.350
Do you know what foreigners love the most when they come to Korea?

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.730
Do you know?

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.670
Take a guess.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.700
You haven't been in touch with your sister for a while, right?

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.240
Yes.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.380
I don't often pick up her calls.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.050
Yes.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.740
Keep in touch often from now on.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.320
After your parents passed away,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.780
it's just the two of you depending on each other.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.410
It's just the two of you left to rely on each other.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.220
Yeah

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.660
We should keep in touch more

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.660
Oh, excuse me

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.860
Nope

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.860
Ugh, pressed the wrong button

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.680
Brother-in-law, where are you going?

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.400
We're on the 10th floor

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.880
Okay

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.260
Brother-in-law can't hold his liquor well

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.150
Brother, this isn't suicide

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.040
You can't just sweep it under the rug without investigating

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.840
Detective Han, what do you mean by sweep it under the rug?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.200
The doctors at the hospital said the same thing

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.810
Said there was no external force involved

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.670
Let's be frank

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.520
You...

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.720
Did you know your niece was being ostracized?

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.140
It might be suicide, you punk

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.830
That's why it should be investigated further

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.950
It might not be just a simple suicide

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.240
Ji-yuk

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.990
The higher-ups want us to stop

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.500
The school foundation is extremely annoyed

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.010
The school is already overwhelmed just dealing with the suicide issue

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.620
And you want to bring in a murder case?

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.580
That's too far, kid

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.610
I understand your feelings more than anyone

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.930
Try to turn a blind eye

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.770
Please?

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.000
If it were your child lying in the hospital, would you do the same?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.010
You little brat...

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.700
You've crossed the line now

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.220
You crossed the line first

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.350
What

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.160
Hey, Han Ji-yoo

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.490
Han Ji-yoo

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.260
(Enter password)

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.360
Darn it

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.560
Bro, it's unbreakable

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.110
Even the US side says it's difficult

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.650
(Lee Kyu-jin)

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.070
You're wearing glasses now

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.780
They suit you

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.620
Thanks

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.870
Looks like there's still no news from the language teacher

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.980
Exactly

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.430
Teacher, you...

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.360
If... you found out someone close was cheating

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.670
What would you do

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.990
As for me...

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.090
But can you be sure what you saw is true

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.060
I'd want to tell everything

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.050
And watch how dramatic things unfold

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.050
Just like a morning drama

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.630
Okay

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.280
Though you were shy at first

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.720
Is uncle your favorite now

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.740
You should also hold mom's hand

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.800
That's really funny, so funny

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.330
-Who is Woo Tae-seok -What

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.000
That was sent to the wrong address.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.770
But the address is correct here.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.400
No, it's for Room 401.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.950
Sometimes the address is written wrong.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.770
-I'll take it over. -No need.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.970
You and Ya-ryu go inside first. I'll take it over.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.480
Just leave it in the management office.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.350
-Okay. -Hmm.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.630
Ya-ryu, do you want to try it?

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.460
(Recipient: Wu Taixi)

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.590
(To: Room 1002, Building 613, Insum Serenity, Phase 3, 22 Jeongunam-gil, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul)

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.970
Room 401?

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.710
Yes, dear.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.350
I'm already at the door.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.150
It's so heavy, my hands could break.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.970
Didn't you say I could buy anything?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.000
Another package came.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.630
It's not mine.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.050
This is your package.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.920
This one? Not sure.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.370
(Wu Taixi)

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.170
(To: Miss Guo Cailin, Room 401, Building 613, Insum Serenity, Phase 3, 22 Jeongunam-gil, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul)

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.210
Guo Cailin

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.300
Ya-ryu

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.380
Come pay respects to grandma.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.420
Okay.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.810
Come pay respects to grandma.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.780
-Where's brother-in-law? -What?

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.330
Said he's in Gumi.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.740
Can't make it back today either?

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.320
If he goes to the Gumi factory

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.180
he usually stays two or three days before coming back.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.840
Sis, are you happy with your marriage?

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.620
Yes, I'm happy, just like anyone else.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.780
Raising kids while living my life.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.190
Sis, you should go to a dermatologist for some care.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.260
Your husband earns so well.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.000
Kim Jung-woo, you've changed a lot, you even nag now.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.170
Mom should see you like this.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.330
Jung-woo.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.520
You…

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.210
The reason you two broke up.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.760
Was it because her family criticized you for being parentless?

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.680
It's not because of that.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.520
Didn't I tell you? She was two-timing.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.790
But it's nice to honor mom together with you.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.290
When we honor dad next time too…

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.800
Sis, you wouldn't still be in contact with that family, would you?

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.150
Well… it's just that…

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.980
Sometimes when uncle calls…

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.440
Sis, are you out of your mind?

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.790
After dad's affair, how did mom manage?

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.150
Did you forget all that?

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.400
What are you thinking by staying in touch with them?

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.560
No, I just…

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.070
You were young back then, you might not know…

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.020
I was planning to marry Soo-yeon as we had planned.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.070
After living together for six years, I thought I'd overlook it.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.460
Because they said it was just a momentary lapse.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.460
Because they said it was a momentary lapse of judgment.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.560
She cried even harder, saying it was all her fault.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.030
But starting at some point

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.990
Dad's face would always come to mind.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.280
Dad probably admitted his mistakes at first too.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.180
Is this how mom feels?

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.980
My favorite face

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.850
Every moment it overlaps with the person I hate the most.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.680
I still love Su-yeon.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.070
I miss her a lot.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.980
But because of dad, I can't face her.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.970
Even if that person is dead, they continue to torment me.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.140
-Crazy, right? -What's going on?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.570
Is this true?

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.920
Not a single day has been calm.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920
Unbelievable

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.870
-Never expected this -Is it really him?

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.660
-The language teacher... -How could this happen?

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.810
Hey, come over quickly...

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:42.890
It's Kim Hye-young and the language teacher.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.390
What are we going to do?

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.690
Stop fooling around.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.000
You were backstabbed by the language teacher.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.070
(No entry, under investigation)

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:02.540
I'm the language teacher at Ark High School, Bang Seong-jin.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.020
During this period, I maintained an improper relationship with students.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.720
I feel very sorry to my family.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.000
When this was exposed

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.150
I could not bear the accompanying shame and guilt.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.620
Therefore, I want to end my life.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.530
Therefore, wanted to end their life.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.110
For the trouble caused by my actions

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.530
I sincerely apologize to everyone

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.430
Bro, don't touch that

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.790
I am wearing gloves

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:39.740
(Will)

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.260
What did they say about the estimated time of death?

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.540
Well...

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.480
Although it needs confirmation after the autopsy

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.000
It looks like the body has been here for at least three days

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.970
It seems like the person didn't die here

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:06.840
What?

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.730
The car was just left in the middle of the parking lot

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.860
And it was only found three days later. Is that reasonable?

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.500
The photo was posted on the school website today

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.460
This means he knew it would be revealed in advance

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.620
Someone is definitely behind this

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.140
Hey, class leader

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.680
We're going to eat spicy rice cakes. Want to join us?

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.470
-Sure -What?

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.110
What's going on? You usually say no

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.180
Are you interested in me?

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.030
Or interested in our friend Xianxi?

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:05.790
(Ark High School)

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.280
Hey, get in the car

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.449
Who are you?

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:15.400
Who is he?

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.190
Community resident

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.770
You can't park here. Hurry and get in

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.850
Hey, mister

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.750
Who are you to tell us whether to get in or not?

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:26.690
Uncle?

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.080
Yeah, uncle.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.980
Isn't this kidnapping?

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.080
Who would kidnap someone in broad daylight like this?

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.159
You must be a crazy uncle.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.120
Hey, call the police.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.429
Quick, get the police here.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:40.820
Want me to call the police for you? Hold on.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.370
Oh, the police are here.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.360
Get in the car quickly.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.590
You're her friend, so why haven't you visited her?

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.810
I'm not doubting you.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.550
You said it yourself.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.350
She had no reason to commit suicide.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.220
Why do you think Seon-ah went back to school that night?

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.760
Excuse me, have you seen

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.200
Seon-ah's glasses?

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.870
Glasses?

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.610
Hey, explain it to me clearly.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.990
What exactly are those glasses?

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.790
Is Seon-ah also related to those glasses?

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.510
Please

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.040
find the glasses.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.700
Then I will tell you.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.060
What are you going to tell me?

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.640
Taxi.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.060
The keys are in the car.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.580
Oh, let's go.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.860
Are you satisfied now?

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.220
Before eating.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.630
What is this?

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.120
Ah, what is it?

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.320
What is this?

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.060
It's so beautiful.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.310
Doing this is really embarrassing.

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.630
Hurry up.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.880
Let me help you put it on.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.880
Come on.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.340
Let's eat.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.450
Hey, brother-in-law, it's Jungwoo.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.790
Ah.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.940
Hey, little brother-in-law, what's up?

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.550
Are you busy?

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.750
Yes, well... I'm in a meeting.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.520
It's not convenient to take a call.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.180
Where are you?

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.640
Right now?

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.770
I'm not in Seoul.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.600
Well... I'll call you later.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.470
Brother-in-law.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.470
I can't reach my sister.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.200
Oh, really?

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.610
Um, I...

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.480
I'll try to contact your sister.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.260
Alright, hanging up now.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.940
-Hold on a bit longer -Okay

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.540
Excuse me, who is it?

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.960
Room service.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.820
Hello...

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.560
L-little brother-in-law.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.890
Let go

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.170
Let go

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.820
What are you doing?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.120
What do you think you're doing, brother-in-law?

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.270
Well...

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.990
Brother-in-law, this situation...

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.800
This situation can easily be misunderstood, that's true

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.500
This is my privacy now...

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.500
No, that's not what I mean

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.380
This won't do any good for your sister

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.830
You certainly are bold

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.130
Shouldn't you apologize first and admit your mistake?

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.600
Okay

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.320
Okay, I'm sorry, I...

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.310
I really can't defend myself

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.000
Wait

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.460
I understand

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.040
I... I'll handle this today

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.350
I promise

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.840
But please give me some more time

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.520
I really will keep my promise

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:18.980
Alright?

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.520
Please resolve this by today

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.970
Otherwise, I really don't know what I might do

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.190
Brother-in-law...

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.290
Don't tell your sister, okay?

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.770
When can we meet again after you go to Canada?

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.160
We've finally gotten in touch, we can meet anytime

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.420
Nowadays, abroad isn't so far away

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.860
I'll call you often

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.110
You need to keep in touch with me.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.940
You too. Call me if anything comes up.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.870
If Yalu wakes up without her uncle, she's going to cause a scene.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.540
It's not much money.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.590
Just take it and use it.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:18.510
-I really don't need it. -Let's go.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.140
Has your brother-in-law contacted you yet?

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.080
What?

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.020
He'll come back when the time is right.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.600
Seems like he's busy with something.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:36.550
We'll be in touch.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.790
No need to see me out.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.960
Morning drama…

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.680
Did it get resolved smoothly?

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.580
No, it didn't.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.900
I'm not really sure.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.940
Probably.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.880
The school is in chaos right now.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.420
Even you're leaving.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.450
I've got mixed feelings.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.190
Thanks so much during this time.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.880
By the way, have you found Kim Hyejin yet?

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.300
No, not yet.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.410
Who uploaded that photo?

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:45.680
Well…

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.340
Many people could have.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.200
And I heard the photo's been circulating on students' social media for a while.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.170
(Ms. Gwak Chae-rin)
Gwak Chae-rin

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.690
Let me help you put it on.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.780
Come on.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.730
(#PregnancyAnnouncement #WelcomeBaby #SeeYouNextYear)

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.170
This lunatic

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.830
The number you dialed is unresponsive…

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.000
Hello, what are you here for?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.500
My passenger wants to go inside

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.100
Sorry, driver, please wait a moment

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.240
Hey, customer…

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.580
-What's going on -Quickly call an ambulance -Hurry

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.110
-119 -Call 119 quickly -Get the police

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.920
-Oh my god -What's happening -Call the police

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.260
Why is that person doing this?

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.910
Hurry and call the police

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.150
-What actually happened -Oh my, pull yourself together

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:53.890
-Oh my god -What happened

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.150
-I said call for an ambulance -No, really…

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.620
-I mean… -Please, stay strong

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.500
What do we do now?

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:04.580
Sister

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.080
Sister, are you alright?

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.250
Sister, open the car door

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.080
She's getting out…

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.390
Are you okay?

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.560
Sister, I'll handle this

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.850
Sister, stay with Yalu…

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.690
Jung-woo, why did you do this

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.920
What do you mean by this?

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.820
What's wrong?

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.860
Why did you do this?

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.190
Sister, why are you doing this?

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.800
Why did you do this after all?

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.190
What's going on, damn it!

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.100
- You... - Brother

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.910
Yeah, are you okay?

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:14.440
Brother, she suddenly drove and kept ramming us.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.720
It's okay, it's okay.

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.080
Let go, you punk!

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.180
What's going on?

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:28.980
Are you even human?

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.160
What the hell are you doing now?

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.500
Let go, damn it!

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.260
Don't do this!

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.020
Don't do this, Jung-woo!

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.650
Damn it!

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.960
What does he mean by that?

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.720
They seem like lunatics.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.580
Let's go.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.820
That person isn't my husband.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.200
That person isn't Kim Byung-chul.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.480
That person's name is Oh Tae-sik.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.360
He's that woman's husband.

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.720
He came because he was afraid I'd kill his pregnant wife.

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.750
Jung-woo, I...

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.410
I...

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.060
I'm the other woman for that man.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.290
What do you mean by that?

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.540
Isn't that what you said?

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.600
Tell him to deal with the mistress and go back to his life.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.240
Jung-woo saw me with Chae-rin.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.600
He told me to end this relationship.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.850
Chae-rin is pregnant too. I think that's the right thing to do.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.920
Why is the car driving like this? It's broken down.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.210
Mom

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.120
Uncle, why are you crying?

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.220
Is Mom not feeling well?

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:07.060
No, it's nothing, Yalu.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.450
How can someone's will be written so carelessly?

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.760
A will…

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.690
A will

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.150
Where are you going?

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:30.330
Home

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.970
Isn't this your home, brother?

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.920
(Hotel)

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:57.480
(Urgently hiring counter staff, any age, beginners welcome) (Guarantee same-day pay, must be punctual)

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.140
Hey, sunglasses

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.040
Why aren't any of you answering the phone?

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.700
Are your phones just accessories?

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.580
The glasses you mentioned, are they these?

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.580
The ones Sana wore

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.930
Aren't they the glasses you were talking about?

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.500
What exactly can you see when wearing those glasses?

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.840
S-line

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.780
S… line?

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:15.890
(Lee Soo Hyuk)

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:19.940
(Arin)

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.980
(And Lee Da Hee)

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.800
So you're saying someone took Sana's glasses

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:39.710
called her to the rooftop

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:41.380
and then pushed her off, right?

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:42.700
But it seems she used the ability to see the S-line

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.480
to threaten many people

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.810
There are people without any sexual experience over there

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:50.750
Teacher, do you have a girlfriend?

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:56.520
I've had sexual relationships with many men lately

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.590
What are those glasses that would cause this?

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.340
If you wear those glasses

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.640
You can see who you've had sexual encounters with

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.480
Another random murder occurred last night in the Jiangyan Cave area

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.480
Is it possible

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.860
There's more than one pair of glasses

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.680
Are there…several pairs of glasses?

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:20.290

Park Woo Jin.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:31.700
Is it okay for you to be in a place like this
with me, leaving Min Yul Hee behind?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.667
Hey, it's fine. It doesn't matter.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.233
She can't dump me now.

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.367
Want to do something fun with me?

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.200
Sure.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.733
It's delicious.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.800
Ah, I'm going to go for a smoke.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.300
- Wait here.
- Come back quickly.

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:11.700
You came all the way here just to see that?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.600
Exactly.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600
I went through all this trouble just to see that.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.033
You?

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:20.067
Are you okay?

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:22.667
If it were me, I wouldn't be okay.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.933
Now that I've seen it for myself, I'm sure.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.733
Let's go now.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.333
Did you come alone?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.767
Hey, let's go.

Are you okay?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.400
Thanks for coming with me.

can I call you

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.267
Sure.

Then would you be okay with
it if your boyfriend did that?

Are you insane?

Then what about Oh Si Eun's phone?

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.667
Why do you have it?

00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:25.867
I'll tell you everything.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.067
My brother, So Mang,

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:32.967
went to the school rooftop that night.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:36.067
He was trying to stop Oh Si Eun
from leaking your video.

00:10:36.067 --> 00:10:40.167
But Oh Si Eun was already
arguing with someone else.

Jezz, give me that!

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:45.233
With whom?

00:10:45.233 --> 00:10:47.800
Then, isn't that person the culprit?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.167
So, did So Mang see the culprit's face?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.533
No.

00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:55.733
It was too dark to see the culprit,

00:10:55.733 --> 00:10:59.467
but he saw Oh Si Eun filming
the other person with her phone.

00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:03.300
Then the culprit's face must be
captured in Oh Si Eun's footage.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.767
I suppose so.

00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:06.967
I kept the phone because of you.

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.667
Because I had to delete the video.

Then,

00:11:12.267 --> 00:11:14.300
what about my video?

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.533
Was it deleted?

00:11:17.467 --> 00:11:20.300
There was a password on the phone,
so I couldn't even open it.

The person who took Oh Si Eun's phone

00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:39.067
is the culprit.

We have to catch that bastard.

My video is one thing,

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:57.600
but that person is definitely
the one who pushed Oh Si Eun.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.533
First, check if that bastard
Lee Deok Min is still in Singapore.

Understood.

But how do we catch them?

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:13.067
Let's start

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:14.967

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:17.567
Everyone, take out some cash.

Hey!

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.667
I saw Oh Si Eun's phone

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.100
in Lee Sa Rang's bag.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.100
Oh Si Eun's phone?

00:12:58.933 --> 00:13:01.067
What's wrong? Why are you here?

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:02.733
You have my video on your phone, don't you?

00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:03.733
Bring it here.

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:05.767
Oh, that dirty sex video of yours?

00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:09.067
Ah, this crazy girl. Are you
high again? Hand it over.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:11.600
I'm recording, so don't mess around.

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:14.167
Got it.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:17.000
- You crazy, hurry up and give it to me.
- Give it back.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.800
- Let go!

I transferred the money right
away, and the date is a bonus.

00:13:45.933 --> 00:13:49.700
Wait! Your number!

00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:14.433
It's not him, either.

Where on earth are they?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.900
Huh? Wait.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.333
Hey, isn't this Park Woo Jin?

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:21.900
He was here too?

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.267
Huh?

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:25.100
That's right.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.700
Right?

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.567
Hey, you're hurt?

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:36.933
Ah, this is a scratch from that bastard.

00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:39.167
I almost caught him.

00:14:40.933 --> 00:14:43.233
But I bet I'm not the only one injured.

00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:46.000
His wrist must be wrecked too.

I can just break off a measly thing like that.

But you, with your amnesia and all,
you'll probably get expelled right away.

Woo Jin can just go study abroad and that's it,

This isn't a deal, but an order.

00:21:10.733 --> 00:21:13.567
Something you have to do.

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:17.233

00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:17.967
So,

00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:20.333
because of that, you're going
to lie about having amnesia

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:22.800
and let Min Yul Hee use you?

00:22:24.067 --> 00:22:26.400
Why is the Diamond 6

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.767

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.800
hated that arrogance of yours the most.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.867
Having something that others are dying to have,

00:22:43.867 --> 00:22:46.233
but saying you're not
interested, that it's boring.

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:49.833
Do you know how miserable
I felt every time you said that?

00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:52.633
Fine, I get it.

00:22:52.633 --> 00:22:54.633
I didn't know about that. But,

00:22:54.633 --> 00:22:56.733
do you really think Min Yul Hee
will get you into the Diamond 6?

00:22:56.733 --> 00:22:57.767
Yes.

00:22:57.767 --> 00:23:01.000
I'm going to make it happen, no matter what.

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:04.633
So you just watch.

00:23:07.233 --> 00:23:10.667
This is why you should choose better company.

00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:14.167
When leeches dare to become Diamond 6 members,

00:23:14.167 --> 00:23:18.100
even third-rate tabloids try
to take down Queen Baek Jenna?

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.500
Hey,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.100
what does that have to do with me?

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.767
There are worse things than leeches.

00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:27.900
For instance, an illegitimate child?

00:23:31.267 --> 00:23:35.133
Ever since that bastard came, it's
been nothing but shady business.

00:23:36.367 --> 00:23:37.933
Baek Jenna,

00:23:37.933 --> 00:23:40.167
will you let us keep fighting like this?

00:23:40.167 --> 00:23:41.767
These days, the other kids
are lumping us all together,

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:44.700
complaining behind our backs about
why only the Diamond 6 gets benefits.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.633
Don't you think you should properly clear this up?

00:23:46.633 --> 00:23:47.800
Clear what up?

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.600
I haven't done anything,
so what is there to clear up?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.767
How

00:23:50.767 --> 00:23:52.467
can you be so selfish?

00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:54.100
Aren't you thinking about Jin Wook?

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.367
It's called a marriage,

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:58.367
but it's really just Hanmyeong and Chasel
Medic doing business with their children.

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:00.967
If the product they're dealing with is defective,

00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:03.933
what does that make Jin Wook,
who agreed to get engaged to you?

00:24:03.933 --> 00:24:06.167
I don't care.

00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:07.167
No,

00:24:07.167 --> 00:24:10.567
it's not that I don't care,
it's that there's no problem.

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:12.500
Because Jenna

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.000
didn't take any drugs.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.067
What?

00:24:15.067 --> 00:24:16.967
Jenna...

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.967
didn't do it.

00:24:19.967 --> 00:24:22.933
So our engagement has

00:24:22.933 --> 00:24:24.233
no issues.

00:24:24.233 --> 00:24:26.600
We'll have to wait and see

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:29.867
if she did or not.

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:32.800
I think we're done talking.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.800
Can I go now?

00:24:36.467 --> 00:24:39.133
Jenna, let's go eat.

00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:51.200
Hey, bastard.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.967
You and I have something to talk about.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.300
Anyone who saw you would be completely
fooled into thinking you're in love.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.733
You two-timing piece of trash
who hits on his fiancée's friend.

00:25:02.733 --> 00:25:03.967
Are you talking about yourself?

00:25:03.967 --> 00:25:06.100
I heard the rumors that
you sleep around with anyone.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.333
You bastard!

00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:08.367
Don't play innocent.

00:25:08.367 --> 00:25:10.733
I saw everything at the club, you trashy bastard.

00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:13.633
I'm going to make it so you can't even
set foot in the Diamond 6, you bastard.

00:25:13.633 --> 00:25:16.000
- Do you have proof?
- You think I don't?

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.267
And even if you do,

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:25.200
can you do anything with it?

00:25:27.433 --> 00:25:30.767
That's just spitting in your own face, you know?

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.600
Woo Jin,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.467
what are you going to do, being so stupid?

00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:39.000
Huh?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.133
Statistically speaking,

00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:42.633
it seems more likely that you'll be

00:25:42.633 --> 00:25:45.100
the one kicked out of the Diamond 6 first.

00:25:47.867 --> 00:25:49.667
I'm leaving.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.733
Has a decision been made on which side

00:26:04.733 --> 00:26:09.467
the Cheongjae Foundation will take, Mr. Chairman?

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.533
It is a matter of great importance,

00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:14.600
so we are discussing it at the foundation level.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.533
The Cheongjae Foundation's coffers will be full

00:26:17.533 --> 00:26:20.433
only when we take over Hanmyeong Holdings.

00:26:20.433 --> 00:26:23.800
There is a timing for everything.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.533
Yes, I'm well aware.

00:26:26.533 --> 00:26:30.567
If it is hard for you to decide,
shall I offer you some help?

00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:36.000
A big problem is about to erupt
at the school because of Hanmyeong.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.233
Mr. Chairman, do you still not know?

00:26:38.233 --> 00:26:39.900
No, well...

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.700
The drug news...

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.267
My man that I planted in Hanmyeong

00:26:44.267 --> 00:26:47.167
works very well.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.133
It would be best to make your decision quickly.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.767
Understood, Mr. Chairman.

00:27:04.767 --> 00:27:06.967
I'll contact you again.

00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:24.733
What?

00:27:24.733 --> 00:27:26.500
Move.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.667
They say

00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:31.267
they saw you putting the drugs in your locker.

00:27:31.267 --> 00:27:33.800
Right, Ga Young?

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.600
Ah...

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.567
Yes.

00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:43.400
You must have been distraught
because of the gossip anyway,

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.000
but how dare someone suspect Baek Jenna!

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:51.767
Now you're resorting
to all sorts of pathetic tricks.

00:27:53.233 --> 00:27:56.300
If you have nothing to hide,
there's no reason you can't open it.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.100
Open it?

00:27:59.467 --> 00:28:00.633
Go ahead and open it.

00:28:00.633 --> 00:28:03.767
Hey, I'll open it for you.

00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:16.000
- There's nothing here.
- What?

00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:18.800
Move aside.

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:30.967
Having fun?

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:33.633
I thought I was dying of boredom.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.733
Where is it?

00:28:36.733 --> 00:28:39.500
What are you doing? Stop it!

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.567
Hey, Leech!

00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:43.967
Where do you think you're butting in?

00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:45.133
Hey, I said stop it!

00:28:45.133 --> 00:28:46.333
- Hey.
- Where did you hide it?

00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:47.667
Where the hell did you hide it?

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:48.667
There's nothing here.

00:28:48.667 --> 00:28:50.467
Hey, hey!

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:54.267
Isn't this it?

00:28:59.133 --> 00:29:01.233
Did you really go this far, Baek Jenna?

00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:04.033
Get lost! Are you all insane?

00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:05.967
But I bet I'm not the only one injured.

00:29:05.967 --> 00:29:09.167
His wrist must be wrecked too.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.600
Won't you hand it over?

00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:17.667
Baek Jenna is a total junkie.

00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:18.667
It was real drugs.

00:29:18.667 --> 00:29:20.967
Wow, the gossip was true.

00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:23.800
Huh? Wow, it's real.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.867
What is this commotion?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.400
Mr. Chairman.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.900
I mean, this was found in our sacred school.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.500
What do we do now?

00:29:41.367 --> 00:29:43.433
Student Baek Jenna, let's talk for a minute.

00:29:43.433 --> 00:29:44.867
Mr. Chairman,

00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:46.533
it's not me.

00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:49.000
Do you think I'd be crazy enough
to do something like this?

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.933
Do you not grasp the situation?

00:29:53.933 --> 00:29:57.000
You need to get tested and clear this up cleanly.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
This isn't something to be emotional about.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.067
Do you think my father will let that happen?

00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:04.433
Chairman Baek has already given his permission.

00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:11.367
Do you get it now?

00:30:11.367 --> 00:30:13.833
Do you understand what kind of situation this is?

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:30.467
Contact Chairman Cha

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:32.500
and tell him I'd like to treat him to dinner soon.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.567
Yes, understood.

00:30:55.267 --> 00:30:57.133
This is Korea, you know.

00:30:57.133 --> 00:30:59.767
A drug charge is the end.

00:30:59.767 --> 00:31:01.233
But there's no way

00:31:01.233 --> 00:31:04.600
the heir to Hanmyeong Group would
do something like drugs, right?

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.167
Hey, but

00:31:06.167 --> 00:31:08.233
what happens if it's true?

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.433
What do you mean 'what happens'?

00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:12.367
Your life is over in a single shot.

00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:15.400
What was the great Baek Jenna lacking
that she would do something like that?

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.700
Exactly, and of all people?

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.567
She must have had her own struggles.

00:31:20.567 --> 00:31:22.167
Her mom's an alcoholic,

00:31:22.167 --> 00:31:24.800
her parents are divorced,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.200
and her teacher became her stepmom.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.367
Oh, no!

00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:33.100
On top of that, she's about
to have a half-brother.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.200
Come to think of it,

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:39.267
wouldn't it be weirder if she didn't do drugs?

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:41.100
Exactly.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.600
Hey, Min Yul Hee,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.500
don't you think you're going too far?

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.300
Why?

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.933
Did my words offend Baek Jenna's

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:51.367
handmaiden?

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:53.467
Looking at her, you really have a strong stomach.

00:31:53.467 --> 00:31:57.067
Becoming a handmaiden for Baek Jenna
just to get into the Diamond 6.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.300
Don't tell me

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.067
you're the one who brought her the drugs.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.367
What makes you so certain?

00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:10.033
What?

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.367
It's obvious.

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:15.733
The results aren't even out yet,
but you act like you know everything.

00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:21.000
I've been feeling this for a while,

00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:25.733
but you're even dumber than I thought.

00:32:25.733 --> 00:32:28.100
If you're so certain,

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.400
aren't you just revealing

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.767
that you're the one who did it?

00:32:34.867 --> 00:32:36.800
Hey!

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.967
Are you that crazy?

00:32:38.967 --> 00:32:42.000
The results aren't out yet.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.700
And you should keep a better
leash on your own fiancé.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.800
There are rumors

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.333
that he's the one doing drugs at clubs these days.

00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:53.733
Ah, you crazy leech! Are you insane?

00:33:00.267 --> 00:33:02.300
Fine!

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.333
Let's wait and see

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.400
what kind of results come out.

00:33:24.133 --> 00:33:28.167
The test came back positive.

00:33:28.167 --> 00:33:31.300
[Cederex positive]

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.567
I'll send you a few photos.

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:48.533
There's a medicine Jenna takes.

00:33:48.533 --> 00:33:49.733
You should

00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:51.267
expose it, Yul Hee.

00:33:51.267 --> 00:33:54.167
If Jenna just takes a drug test,

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.767
something interesting will happen.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.833
Medicine?

[The animal scenes were staged, in
compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.966
Wow, look who is here.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.510
It is Prince Gyeongseong.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.076
<i>Do they know each other?</i>

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.656
Did you forget how to greet, by chance?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.976
Of course not.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.556
Greet even your sworn enemy politely.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.796
That is what my parents taught me to do.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760
Have you been well?

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.290
You cannot suddenly appear
and behave so rudely toward her.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.330
She is my fiancée.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.626
My goodness.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.706
I made a mistake.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.846
Anyway, thank you for
helping me today, Sun Chaek.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.856
How dare you call my
fiancée's name like that?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.116
You still know to cross the line.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.076
Sun Chaek and I share childhood

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.900
memories you are not aware of.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.996
She helped me when I was in trouble.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.956
Do not tell me I need your approval

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.940
for every little thing like this.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.286
Enjoy your time together, then.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.500
See you again, Sun Chaek.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.280
This concludes our outing today.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.830
Let us go home.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.036
Are you upset about earlier, by chance?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.610
Not at all.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.186
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.110
- What happened earlier-
- I do not want to know.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.500
By the way, how do you
know Prince Seonghyeon?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.796
Our time together is precious enough.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.980
I do not want to waste
time talking about him.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.820
Here.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.660
You're right.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.630
Let's only focus on our future from now on.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.110
We're already here.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.350
Oh, right.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.066
Ta-da.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.656
- What are they?
- In any situation,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.206
these bracelets will connect us together.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.116
Consider it a token of my affection
before the wedding.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.450
A man cannot wear such a thing.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.980
It suits you well.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.866
You need to remember
something as my lover, then.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.956
You cannot dare to be
in another man's arms.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.950
Got it. I'll keep that in
mind, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.760
Cha Seon Chaek!

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.780
F-Father.

[Episode 8: Return of the shadow]

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.580
Sun Chaek is Prince Gyeongseong's fiancée?

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.260
Are you okay?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.000
I am not okay.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.766
What if I cannot get married because of it?

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.776
I will take responsibility, then.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.506
Are you not using this as an excuse

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.076
because you want to marry me?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.946
I am not, okay?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.286
Unless you become
handsome when you grow up.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.146
Do not obsess over me
because I got too handsome.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.856
That will never happen.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.460
I am a self-respecting woman.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.816
Remember.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.020
You had your first kiss with me.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.380
<i>My Lady! Young Master! Where are you?</i>

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.620

What's going on?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.930
Did I really get locked up?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.656

Fire!

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.786
I coddled you too much.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.296
- Father.
- That is how we ended up here.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.150
I can no longer maintain civility.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.316
Your Excellency, do you have to do this?

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.066
You also look down on me
because I did not do anything.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.196
I am planning to be a
strict father from now on.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.136
No one is allowed to

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.966
open this door until I tell you to.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.860
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.286
Do not do this. Please go now.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.006
His Excellency is furious.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.486
Is My Lady okay?

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.316
She ended up getting locked up.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.346
She should have behaved better.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.156
I need to see the Chief State Minister.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.376
Notify him now.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.056
He is not in the mood for that now.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.436
If I upset him now,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.746
you may never be able to see her again.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.910
I will close the door.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.480
Not a chance this time!

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.656
I am sorry, My Lady.

Have you been well, Your Majesty?

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.046
You wish the killer of your parents well?

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.856
Are you being sincere?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.606
Please do not say that.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.996
It cannot be easy for you to face me.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.996
I moved on from my past
while traveling to other countries.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.086
I do not even remember anymore.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.106
I do not believe what people say.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.916
I heard you were traveling.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.946
What made you suddenly return?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.596
Not for a particular reason.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.066
I grew tired of wandering for a long time,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.456
and I just missed my homeland.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.600
Are you sure that is all?

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.676
It is impossible to fool you.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.466
Actually, my friends got me to
gamble, and I lost my fortune.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.690
I am left with nothing.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.436
But I guess that was not the end of me.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.640
In the last round,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.940
I acquired something
more valuable than money.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.436
What is this?

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.036
It is a rare medicine even the
Chinese Emperor covets.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.276
It will restore your energy effectively.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.286
I appreciate the gesture.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.126
You must know the Chinese
envoys well, as they say.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.466
So, how are things in China these days?

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.256
As you know,

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.306
I am a good-for-nothing
who is not interested in politics.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.616
But I will share what I overheard

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.106
with you from time to time, Your Majesty.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.220
Yes. That is not a bad idea.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.136
There will be a royal family gyeokgu ♪
event soon. (A sport similar to polo)

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.296
Feel free to participate if you wish.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.120
It will be my honor, Your Majesty.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.516
Prince Seonghyeon suddenly returned.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.216
What is he thinking?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.866
Since he returned to Hanyang,

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.816
he has not done anything in particular yet.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.066
If Prince Gyeongseong is a hunting dog,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.540
is Prince Seonghyeon more like a wild dog?

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.830
I shall make those two dogs have
a match this time around.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.286
He looks very familiar.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.896
Is that a new robe?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.610
How pretty.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.330
Is that... P-Prince Seonghyeon?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.496
My Lady, time to eat.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.656
How's Prince Gyeongseong?
He must be shocked.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.586
He came here first thing in the morning,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.376
and he is camping outside the gate.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.806
He must be freezing.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.160
Could there be a solution?

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.506
There is none until you change
His Excellency's mind.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.036
Because I'm trapped here,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.246
I can't meet him or talk to him.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.520
What do I do?

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.886
Bang Wool, get me
paper and thread right now.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.956
I need a whole bunch of threads.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.090
A bunch? All right. I will bring them.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.540
I forgot.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.160
I will be right back.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.550
A little more. A little more.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.000
Good.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.456
Communication device installed.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.750
Bang Wool, take this to Prince Gyeongseong.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.870
My Lord!

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.850
<i>Prince Gyeongseong, can you hear me?</i>

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.420
I miss you, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.996
I need to settle this matter.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.390
Trust me, and wait a bit.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.696
Settle this matter?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.620
I have a few ideas, too.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.846
What do you think?

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.840
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.820
<i>Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.790
<i>H-Hello?</i>

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.280
H-Hello?

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.350
Prince Gyeongseong!

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.200
I need to talk to you fellows.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.086
Why are you pouring us drinks?

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.216
I would like your advice.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.960
Advice? From us?

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.210
Do you have an idea for me
to win your father's heart?

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.776
I mean, do you think we are so easy?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.580
I could never tell you.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.080
<i>Coax the supporters.</i>

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.770
<i>My brothers can't resist gifts.</i>

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.410
Hyungnim. Hyungnim.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.646
Wine. Our father loves wine.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.266
Come on, Se Ho.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.496
He has been drinking more these days.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.896
Mountain ginseng!

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.346
Father likes mountain ginseng, too.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.036
W-Watch yourselves.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.326
Do you not have any self-respect at all?

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.820
- No.
- No.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.810
I am not drunk yet.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:48.320
I will not fall for something like this.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.876
Have a glass,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.620
Big Brother.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.826
Big Brother?

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.710
<i>Brother-in-law!</i>

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.450
Brother-in-law...

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.800
<i>Brother-in-law!</i>

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.686
Prince Gyeongseong is my brother-in-law!

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.730
<i>Brother-in-law!</i>

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.520
Can't believe he'll be our brother-in-law...

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.550
It is a 30-year-old mountain ginseng wine.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.046
Prince Gyeongseong,

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.806
this is not mountain ginseng.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.046
It is farmed ginseng.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.836
I hope you are not mocking me.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.250
I am disappointed, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.146
Until you approve us,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.690
I will not take even a step away from here.

00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:16.952
My Lady, time to eat.

00:21:17.718 --> 00:21:19.908
Lady Sun Chaek.

00:21:23.444 --> 00:21:25.454
My Lady.

00:21:29.144 --> 00:21:30.560
My Lady.

00:21:30.584 --> 00:21:32.184
Bang Wool.

00:21:33.304 --> 00:21:34.900
What happened to Prince Gyeongseong?

00:21:34.924 --> 00:21:36.150
Will Father let us get married?

00:21:36.174 --> 00:21:37.890
It is not that.

00:21:37.914 --> 00:21:41.140
Prince Gyeongseong is still
kneeling in the front yard

00:21:41.164 --> 00:21:44.540
and His Excellency continues to ignore him.

00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:46.170
- I need to go. I need to go.
- No!

00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:50.664
You will only make it
worse by going there now!

00:21:57.634 --> 00:22:00.660
I'm so frustrated.

00:22:00.684 --> 00:22:04.724
- My Lady.
- What should I do?

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:10.014
There is nothing I can do.

00:22:11.504 --> 00:22:13.184
My Lady.

00:22:16.734 --> 00:22:19.894
This is not good.

00:22:24.554 --> 00:22:27.860
My Lady, I have no choice.

00:22:27.884 --> 00:22:29.630
Whether you are grounded or not,

00:22:29.654 --> 00:22:32.130
I need to save you first.

00:22:32.154 --> 00:22:33.814
Let us go.

00:22:35.884 --> 00:22:37.584
Really?

00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:47.280
Please get up now.

00:22:47.304 --> 00:22:51.610
I cannot get up until
you give your approval.

00:22:51.634 --> 00:22:54.130
If kneeling would have resolved this,

00:22:54.154 --> 00:22:58.300
what would be impossible in this world?

00:22:58.324 --> 00:23:00.864
Please come inside for now.

00:23:06.284 --> 00:23:08.224
Hand me that.

00:23:09.124 --> 00:23:10.684
Goodness.

00:23:11.674 --> 00:23:13.700
You got covered in snow.

00:23:13.724 --> 00:23:16.364
You must have been so cold.

00:23:25.784 --> 00:23:30.780
I understand how
determined you are now, but.

00:23:30.804 --> 00:23:33.660
Do you mean you still cannot approve us?

00:23:33.684 --> 00:23:36.810
Any father would want their
daughters to get married

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:40.030
and live happily and
healthy for a long time.

00:23:40.054 --> 00:23:42.160
I will make her happier than anyone.

00:23:42.184 --> 00:23:45.890
You have had blood on
your hands for His Majesty

00:23:45.914 --> 00:23:48.600
for over a decade now.

00:23:48.624 --> 00:23:52.520
It must mean there are that many people

00:23:52.544 --> 00:23:55.440
who want you to see your blood.

00:23:55.464 --> 00:23:57.480
If you get married and have children,

00:23:57.504 --> 00:24:00.500
they will be the targets
for those who are after you

00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:04.414
and they will become your weakness.

00:24:10.994 --> 00:24:13.200
However

00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:16.510
a grown man and woman love each other.

00:24:16.534 --> 00:24:20.844
I cannot follow you around
and stop you forever.

00:24:22.344 --> 00:24:27.860
I wonder if you really have the character
and the spirit to protect my daughter.

00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:31.884
I would like to test your potential.

00:24:32.784 --> 00:24:35.594
Please promise me one thing.

00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:45.260
For our family and Sun Chaek's reputation,

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:48.710
I will let you see each other, but

00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:53.870
I hope you refrain from
her staying out overnight.

00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:57.120
Please protect Sun Chaek.

00:24:57.144 --> 00:25:01.380
I will make sure to keep that promise.

00:25:01.404 --> 00:25:05.510
If so, I will count on you.

00:25:05.534 --> 00:25:07.284
Wife.

00:25:09.094 --> 00:25:13.990
I will allow Sun Chaek to come out now.

00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:15.524
Yes.

00:25:23.604 --> 00:25:27.154
Sun Chaek, your father finally.

00:25:44.324 --> 00:25:45.850
My Lady.

00:25:45.874 --> 00:25:48.064
Long time no see.

00:25:50.734 --> 00:25:53.354
I thought you forgot about me.

00:25:54.594 --> 00:25:58.204
I've been so out of it.

00:25:59.664 --> 00:26:02.840
Was the solution you
got from here last time

00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:04.810
effective at all?

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:06.914
The solution?

00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:13.284
The thing you purchased from here, My Lady.

00:26:16.894 --> 00:26:20.700
Y-Yes, yes. I suppose so...

00:26:20.724 --> 00:26:25.240
What concern brought you here today, then?

00:26:25.264 --> 00:26:27.684
Well, the thing is...

00:26:28.784 --> 00:26:31.050
There is an obstacle to your love.

00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:34.910
How perilous. You might
never be able to marry.

00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:36.520
Your feet were tied, and
the thread was cut off.

00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:38.010
You are so frustrated right now.

00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:40.524
How did you know that?

00:26:44.514 --> 00:26:46.300
Love, reunion, and popularity talismans.

00:26:46.324 --> 00:26:49.700
They are my special talismans,
approved by reviews.

00:26:49.724 --> 00:26:51.764
Talismans?

00:26:58.154 --> 00:27:02.154
Aigoo. It knows who it belongs to.

00:27:04.134 --> 00:27:07.800
Hide this in the man's bedding.

00:27:07.824 --> 00:27:12.490
It will get rid of everyone
who interferes with your marriage.

00:27:12.514 --> 00:27:16.370
Since you are a regular, I will
give you a special discount.

00:27:16.394 --> 00:27:18.104
Should I buy this?

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:22.150
I think I should buy it.

00:27:22.174 --> 00:27:24.100
There you are again.

00:27:24.124 --> 00:27:25.740
Let me run my business.

00:27:25.764 --> 00:27:28.674
I am trying to make a
living. How could you.

00:27:40.304 --> 00:27:42.860
Where is the real one?

00:27:42.884 --> 00:27:45.300
The wrong girl is sitting here instead.

00:27:45.324 --> 00:27:47.290
Looking at you,

00:27:47.314 --> 00:27:50.230
I can tell things are not going your way.

00:27:50.254 --> 00:27:53.104
I could even say stuff like that.

00:27:58.554 --> 00:28:00.614
I don't like this...

00:28:03.394 --> 00:28:05.700
You are at a crossroads.

00:28:05.724 --> 00:28:08.470
You had better choose wisely.

00:28:08.494 --> 00:28:10.590
Crossroads?

00:28:10.614 --> 00:28:15.744
The only thing you can do freely
in life is to make choices.

00:28:17.304 --> 00:28:18.630
Just wait and see.

00:28:18.654 --> 00:28:22.710
You will be at the crossroads
where you have to decide soon.

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:25.700
Of course, no one knows
the results of the decisions.

00:28:25.724 --> 00:28:27.884
That includes me, a deity.

00:28:29.924 --> 00:28:35.554
That makes life and stories
more interesting, right?

00:28:39.734 --> 00:28:41.420
You ended up buying that.

00:28:41.444 --> 00:28:43.810
You are so gullible, My Lady.

00:28:43.834 --> 00:28:47.640
<i>Does she really know something about me?</i>

00:28:47.664 --> 00:28:49.900
It feels strange.

00:28:49.924 --> 00:28:51.970
Did she really say that knowingly?

00:28:51.994 --> 00:28:54.380
I do not believe in that stuff,

00:28:54.404 --> 00:28:57.190
but she sounded kind of believable today.

00:28:57.214 --> 00:28:59.620
Did you think so, too?

00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:02.330
Might as well test it now.

00:29:02.354 --> 00:29:06.364
You paid money for
it. Try something with it.

00:29:13.324 --> 00:29:16.560
What brings you here so late?

00:29:16.584 --> 00:29:19.010
Are you celebrating your freedom?

00:29:19.034 --> 00:29:20.870
Am I no longer grounded?

00:29:20.894 --> 00:29:22.950
Did you and Father come to an agreement?

00:29:22.974 --> 00:29:24.850
So, you were not freed.

00:29:24.874 --> 00:29:26.090
You ran away.

00:29:26.114 --> 00:29:29.780
Come on. That's not important.

00:29:29.804 --> 00:29:33.654
The fact that we're
together now is important.

00:29:35.184 --> 00:29:38.024
I missed you, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:29:43.534 --> 00:29:45.680
It's cold tonight.

00:29:45.704 --> 00:29:48.394
Can I come in for a moment?

00:29:52.644 --> 00:29:54.700
You cannot come in.

00:29:54.724 --> 00:29:57.400
Until your father approves our marriage,

00:29:57.424 --> 00:30:00.710
I promised not to lay a finger
on his precious daughter.

00:30:00.734 --> 00:30:05.190
If he hears I brought you into
the men's quarters right away,

00:30:05.214 --> 00:30:07.184
I would be in trouble.

00:30:12.384 --> 00:30:16.760
But there seems to be no one around.

00:30:16.784 --> 00:30:21.090
I think I could just sneak in.

00:30:21.114 --> 00:30:22.740
If I were to break the promise so easily,

00:30:22.764 --> 00:30:25.100
I would not have made the
promise in the first place.

00:30:25.124 --> 00:30:29.134
Do you think lightly of a man's promise?

00:30:30.444 --> 00:30:35.760
Do you care more about
that promise than me?

00:30:35.784 --> 00:30:38.764
I suppose you didn't miss me.

00:30:50.124 --> 00:30:54.084
If you tempt me with a face like that

00:31:02.874 --> 00:31:05.114
it would be difficult for me.

00:31:06.084 --> 00:31:10.924
Could you please leave
now, Maiden Cha Sun Chaek?

00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:28.894
How could you, Prince Gyeongseong?

00:31:46.364 --> 00:31:48.250
[How dare you expect to be happy]

00:31:48.274 --> 00:31:50.060
[sitting on top of someone's blood?]

00:31:50.084 --> 00:31:53.620
[How despicable. Not
only you but your people]

00:31:53.644 --> 00:31:59.604
[and everyone around you will not be safe]

00:32:04.804 --> 00:32:07.000
How could he do this to me?

00:32:07.024 --> 00:32:09.654
How could you, Prince Gyeongseong!

00:32:12.014 --> 00:32:13.584
Sun Chaek.

00:32:15.944 --> 00:32:17.924
Jang Ho.

00:32:18.764 --> 00:32:23.514
Where did you go as soon as you were freed?

00:32:25.564 --> 00:32:28.530
You must have been frustrated. I am sorry.

00:32:28.554 --> 00:32:32.970
But Father still hasn't approved
the marriage yet. I'm worried.

00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:34.900
He said he would keep an eye on things,

00:32:34.924 --> 00:32:38.390
but this is a huge improvement.

00:32:38.414 --> 00:32:42.360
Please, all of you, convince
Father and help me out.

00:32:42.384 --> 00:32:44.930
A-All right.

00:32:44.954 --> 00:32:49.540
I could see Prince Gyeongseong's
good qualities up close.

00:32:49.564 --> 00:32:52.004
- I know, right?
- Yes.

00:32:52.924 --> 00:32:55.740
Well, by the way...

00:32:55.764 --> 00:32:58.560
Do you have something else to say?

00:32:58.584 --> 00:33:01.130
By chance, did you know?

00:33:01.154 --> 00:33:02.210
Know what?

00:33:02.234 --> 00:33:04.744
I think Prince Seonghyeon is back.

00:33:06.154 --> 00:33:07.740
After he returned from his exile,

00:33:07.764 --> 00:33:09.510
he disappeared and

00:33:09.534 --> 00:33:11.460
grew apart from our family.

00:33:11.484 --> 00:33:15.874
Exile? Isn't that for criminals?

00:33:17.234 --> 00:33:19.570
I am talking about the
killings among royals that

00:33:19.594 --> 00:33:22.320
took place when the
current King began ruling.

00:33:22.344 --> 00:33:25.720
Prince Seonghyeon lost his parents then.

00:33:25.744 --> 00:33:30.530
In that process, he grew apart from Prince
Gyeongseong, who sided with the King.

00:33:30.554 --> 00:33:34.534

get to give this to him?

You do not have to tell me.

00:49:58.099 --> 00:50:01.959

watch a bit crookedly.

What is with your neck? It is crooked.

00:50:07.059 --> 00:50:09.709
It is because I am
jealous of the groom-to-be.

By the way, where are you headed to?

00:50:13.879 --> 00:50:16.345

I looked everywhere,

I will not be treated.

But why...

Whenever I am starting to forget
the past, I see my blood

and am reminded of my family's
blood and screams clearly.

Compared to their pain,

00:55:12.129 --> 00:55:14.619
this is nothing.

Now is the time for everything
to get back into place.

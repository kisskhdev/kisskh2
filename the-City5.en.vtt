ALL CHILD ACTORS FILMED SAFELY

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.901
What brings you here?
There was no heads-up.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:53.280
Why are you so surprised?
Were you two watching something naughty?

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:53.280
Why are you so surprised?
Were you two watching something naughty?

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.033
You could've at least called first.
Did you eat dinner?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.243
Probably not.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:01:59.411
Go wash your hands.

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.496
- Want some snacks?
- Yeah.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.457
No snacks.
That'll ruin your appetite.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.167
Wait until after dinner.

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.882
I've become a chairman now.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.050
What? Chairman of what?

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.638
It's just a volunteer group made with
other business people. I became its chair.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.141
There you go bragging
about useless things again.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.141
There you go bragging
about useless things again.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:46.750
You asked to meet,

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.419
but you're just as quiet as ever.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.591
Was I like this before too?

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:55.717
Yeah.

00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.219
When we broke up.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.935
Why did you want to see me?
The trial's already over.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.187
It's just…

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.317
I hadn't seen you in a while,

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:15.570
but it felt like
we didn't get to have a proper talk.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.032
Have you been all right?

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.951
Yeah.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:20.951
Yeah.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.204
I've been fine, as you can see.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.376
I haven't been, as you probably know.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.049
About the trial…

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.385
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.388
It was the best I could do.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.388
It was the best I could do.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.265
I felt it was better to end it quickly.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.349
I know.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.685
Ending it quickly was the right call.

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:48.770
For me too.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.863
After hurting you like that…

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:01.700
I deserved it.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.618
Right?

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:08.623
No.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.500
I didn't think that.

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.500
I didn't think that.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.461
I just thought

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:16.298
it would've been better
if we hadn't run into each other this way.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.966
If we had met differently,

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.385
you wouldn't have talked to me.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.385
you wouldn't have talked to me.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:26.975
Sujeong.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:29.978
Take care of yourself.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.606
I came here to tell you this.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.994
This was the side of you
I liked the most.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.374
Okay.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:55.879
I came to say goodbye too.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:04:59.925
Right.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.511
Let's not meet again.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.221
Especially like this.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.601
Later on, if something really good
happens in your life,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.936
send me a text.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.936
send me a text.

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.110
I will take care of myself.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.613
Thanks.

The Courage to Face It

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.267
Excuse me.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.267
Excuse me.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.271
Juhyeong left already. You should go.

<i>Can you come out for a moment?</i>

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.141
<i>Can you come out for a moment?</i>

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:53.830
Well,

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.374
- I called you here to--
- Let me go first.

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.464
I turned Park Sujeong away.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.053
After what happened last night,
I went down and she was waiting outside.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.597
Before I knew it, I told her
you'd already left work.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.597
Before I knew it, I told her
you'd already left work.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.435
I crossed the line. I'm sorry.
I should've told you right away.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.691
Why did you do that?

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.691
Why did you do that?

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:26.363
Well…

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.450
I'm not sure. Why did I do that?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.450
I'm not sure. Why did I do that?

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.122
I guess I didn't want you to get hurt.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:47.258
I didn't think it'd be good for you
to run into her in that state,

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.094
so that's why I did it.

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:54.099
It could've hurt you
even though it's all in the past already.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.061
I mean, maybe not for you yet. But…

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.691
- So what I mean is…
- It is in the past.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.691
- So what I mean is…
- It is in the past.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:08.863
You were right.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.366
It was stupid to take that case on.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.366
It was stupid to take that case on.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.036
It didn't sit right with me.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.415
But I'm really okay now.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.250
That's what I came to say.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.250
That's what I came to say.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.043
So…

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.422
you don't need to feel bad.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.818
I saw last time you didn't have
any emergency snacks.

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.237
So, I grabbed a few
while I was getting mine.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.531
Just a few.

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:57.454
Thanks.

- What on earth?
- You scared me!

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.253
What's with all that money?
You haven't spent a dime?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.714
Geez, why are you peeking
at someone else's account?

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.424
- I'll sue you!
- Go ahead.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:51.424
- I'll sue you!
- Go ahead.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.301
We're not strangers.

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:54.803
- Security!
- Security!

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:56.096
I have a problem here!

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.598
- We're fine. We're fine!
- I have a problem! Security!

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:09.609
That's good.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.861
Let's eat here again in two weeks.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:11.861
Let's eat here again in two weeks.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.281
I told you to dip it in the salted shrimp.
It tastes better.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.660
I can eat on my own.
Who even dips peppers in salted shrimp?

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:24.082
Right. He's got a ton of money.
It's crazy.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:27.502
- It's fake news.
- It's not fake news.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.171
With all that money,
why are you still living there?

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.171
With all that money,
why are you still living there?

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.339
Just move already.

00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:33.967
Grandpa saved up that much
without us knowing?

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.178
What's there to hide?
And I don't have that much either.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:38.888
But why do you call him "Grandpa"?

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.683
Everything he does is like a grandpa.
Don't you think so?

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.683
Everything he does is like a grandpa.
Don't you think so?

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.101
- Come, now!
- Not at all.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.477
He's like a cunning fox.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:45.812
What was your nickname?

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.148
You must've had one in school.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.816
"The Spirit of Spring."

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.280
Was that supposed to be funny?

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:58.241
That wasn't funny or moving at all.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.118
It wasn't even thought-provoking.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.118
It wasn't even thought-provoking.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.619
Hey, you're paying for this.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.705
You're not funny, but you're loaded.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.708
- That's crossing the line.
- Don't you have more money?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.668
That's my dad's money, not mine.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.336
Your father's rich?

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.336
Your father's rich?

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:15.466
He does run a small, successful company,
but he's not super rich or anything.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.720
It made some money subcontracting
for Hanguk Group, but without that…

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.555
It would've gone under instantly.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.555
It would've gone under instantly.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:23.266
- I've told you several times.
- It's my first time asking.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:27.145
In any case, it's all yours in the end.
You're the only child.

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.731
I'm sick of hearing that only child talk.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.233
Are you trying to pick a fight
with six million of us?

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.233
Are you trying to pick a fight
with six million of us?

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.111
- And you're pretty well-off too.
- Says who?

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:37.363
I mean, you all went to law school.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.073
That's a risky thing to say.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.872
We're not all well-off like you.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:49.042
Others may mistakenly think so,
but we know better.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.921
Why are you being so serious?
You're the one with all that money.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.921
Why are you being so serious?
You're the one with all that money.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.680
Geez, bringing up money was a bad idea.

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:03.932
You brought it up.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.308
Yeah, I was telling myself.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.519
Me and my big mouth.
I can't keep it shut.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.946
There doesn't seem to be any improvement.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.074
Well, I'm pregnant,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.074
Well, I'm pregnant,

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.117
so I couldn't take the meds
you prescribed.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.162
Really? Congratulations.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.122
Your husband must be thrilled.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:33.002
I'm still not sure

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.838
if this is something
to be congratulated for.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.929
<i>In that case, I'll switch your meds</i>
<i>to ones safe for pregnancy.</i>

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.929

A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.540
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.709
Retail investors are idiots.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.963
If a stock shows the slightest uptick,
they charge in like rabid dogs.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.299
Are you talking about me?

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.302
- You're a retail investor?
- Of course.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.095
Goddamn!

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.473
That's hilarious!

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.058
I'm sorry.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.352
Anyways…

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.352
Anyways…

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.354
- Yes?
- The second the freeze lifts,

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.023
we dump all our shares.

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.608
But these suckers eat them all up.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:39.986
That's how we pocket the profit,

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:43.281
and the stock tanks like crazy
until it's worth pennies.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.867
Then, we do a reverse split,
take the profits,

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.910
and repeat the cycle until delisting.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.539
That's how I was duped.
I think that's where all my money went.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.539
That's how I was duped.
I think that's where all my money went.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.335
When I get out, you want to join me?

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.004
I'll make you some real money.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.134
I appreciate the thought.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.638
If I was meant to get rich,
I'm sure it'll naturally happen.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.391
I mean, I'd lose my law license over this.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.391
I mean, I'd lose my law license over this.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.815
What do you need
that fancy law license for?

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:18.941
Tell me.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.694
You're just a goddamn errand boy
here to keep me company.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.694
You're just a goddamn errand boy
here to keep me company.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.784
I can shoot the breeze
and earn a paycheck.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.828
That's a great deal.
Don't you think so?

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.828
That's a great deal.
Don't you think so?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.377
See? You're nuts.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.254
That's why I like you, Attorney Cho.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.254
That's why I like you, Attorney Cho.

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.464
Thank you.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.257
Sir,

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.677
how long do I have to do these visits for?

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.431
Do you know how much we make
just for making those visits?

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.431
Do you know how much we make
just for making those visits?

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:53.434
If you can pull in clients
of that value, I'll tell you.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:54.852
Or…

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.689
If you bring in the retainer contract
from your father's company,

00:14:58.773 --> 00:14:59.941
I'll take you off visits.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.029
Never mind, sir.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.657
The trial won't drag on, so just do it.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.326
No need to go daily.
Every other day is fine.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.326
No need to go daily.
Every other day is fine.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.079
Yes, sir. I understand.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.748
Isn't this easier for you too?

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:19.418
You just go there and have fun.

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:22.713
If I were you,
I'd be thanking my lucky stars.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:22.023
This isn't theft. It's actually called
misappropriation of lost property.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:22.023
This isn't theft. It's actually called
misappropriation of lost property.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:25.318
I seriously don't remember anything.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.571
Did you drink a lot of alcohol?

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.698
Well, job hunting's been rough,

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.698
Well, job hunting's been rough,

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.492
so I went out drinking with friends
to relieve some stress.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.120
And I think I got carried away.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.956
Do you recall
going to the convenience store?

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.293
I don't remember that either.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:45.713
When I get drunk, I usually have
one last beer at a convenience store.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.049
So I probably did go.

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:52.470
But the police said CCTV captured me
taking the watch that was there.

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:52.470
But the police said CCTV captured me
taking the watch that was there.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.724
But if you did take it,
it should be at home, right?

00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:58.184
There's absolutely nothing.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.852
That's what's driving me crazy.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.187
If it was at home,

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.187
If it was at home,

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.981
I could apologize
for making a mistake while I was drunk.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.816
But that isn't the case.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.406
For now, don't admit to anything
during the police questioning.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.406
For now, don't admit to anything
during the police questioning.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.910
Just tell them honestly
that you don't remember.

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.746
But…

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.333
What if they punish me harder
for being uncooperative?

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.333
What if they punish me harder
for being uncooperative?

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:24.794
During the investigation,

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:28.214
the police may or may not
show you the footage.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.926
But if you say you don't remember,
they'll probably show it to you.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.926
But if you say you don't remember,
they'll probably show it to you.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.928
It won't be too late to admit it then.

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:37.890
I swear I didn't hit anyone.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.852
I've been teaching for over 10 years
and never once used physical punishment.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.852
I've been teaching for over 10 years
and never once used physical punishment.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.066
Are these the kids' names?

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.696
No, the lawsuit was filed
under the parents' names.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.696
No, the lawsuit was filed
under the parents' names.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.823
Then, do you know
which kids pressed charges?

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.366
Yes, I know who they are.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:59.245
I caught them using the gym after class
without permission, so I scolded them.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:03.040
But a few days later, the police called.
They said I was reported for child abuse.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:03.040
But a few days later, the police called.
They said I was reported for child abuse.

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.128
But do middle schoolers
count as children too?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.923
Yes, anyone under 18
is legally considered a child.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.923
Yes, anyone under 18
is legally considered a child.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.926
You only gave them a warning

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.179
- without any physical punishment, right?
- Yes.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.807
It says here that you made them lie prone

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.435
- and hit their backsides.
- That never happened.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.435
- and hit their backsides.
- That never happened.

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.270
After the police contacted me,

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.023
I wondered if I was too harsh
with my words.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.526
But when I saw that complaint
and it mentioned all that, I was shocked.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:30.526
But when I saw that complaint
and it mentioned all that, I was shocked.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.322
I only scold my students with words.

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:35.740
Gently.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.080
Right. Let's start
by getting the kids' names.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:46.000
KIM SANGJUN, LEE MINHYUK, IM GIHOON,

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.462
Do you have Newstagram?

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.047
What?

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.424
Geez, you can make an account
and check yourself.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.218
Why are you making me do this?

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.512
It's a hassle.
I don't know how to use it either.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.597
There's no time to read the terms.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.597
There's no time to read the terms.

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.391
Why read the terms?

00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:45.810
You have to read them.
Who knows what's in there?

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:48.437
What a lunatic.

Gosh.

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:06.789
You're sure he didn't hit them?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.334
Now what?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.334
Now what?

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.336
Try surfing the net.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.504
What?

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.427
You know,
like surfing through friends' pages.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.553
Surfing the net.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.553
Surfing the net.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:21.721
Surfing…

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:24.265
You mean looking at his followers.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.145
But I doubt those kids
would follow his account.

00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.105

They're not here.

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:48.456
I guess not.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.416
Damn it. Then…

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.416
Damn it. Then…

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.418
Then…

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:55.713
Why don't we do this?

00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:58.758
Let's look for students
who attend this school.

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:03.471
<i>Mr. Hwang,</i>
<i>let's go here for our next class trip.</i>

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:07.183
"Yea.na14."
She seems like a middle schooler.

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:09.185
Gosh, how should I deal with this then?

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.813
Let's look for a boy's name.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.813
Let's look for a boy's name.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.274
Nothing here.

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:17.943
LET'S GO EAT <i>TTEOKBOKKI</i>

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.278
She seems the most popular.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:23.115
I see boys here.

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:28.537
Jooan?

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.748
See, I found some boys.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.748
See, I found some boys.

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:35.586
Hold on.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.591
- "Sangjun Kim"?
- Kim Sangjun.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.591
- "Sangjun Kim"?
- Kim Sangjun.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:44.929
Is this him?

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.310
We found him.

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.310

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.369
"Lee Minhyuk and others liked this post."

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.412
Lee Minhyuk, Im Gihoon… It's them, right?

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.412
Lee Minhyuk, Im Gihoon… It's them, right?

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.374
Lee Minhyeok, Im Gihoon, Jang Seongbin…

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.708
It is them.

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:18.546
Geez, we found them.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.549
- Yeah.
- That means I have to go there now.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.549
- Yeah.
- That means I have to go there now.

00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.137
Want to come with me?

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.016
I'm off.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:32.726
Damn.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.019
Good luck!

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.181
NO ENTRY AFTER SCHOOL HOURS
SEHYEON MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.181
NO ENTRY AFTER SCHOOL HOURS
SEHYEON MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:23:22.526 --> 00:23:24.570
Pass the ball! Why aren't you passing?

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.405
Damn it.

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:51.096
Kim Sangjun.

00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:53.849
Lee Minhyuk.

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:56.101
Im Gihoon.

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.772
Let's see. Jang Seongbin.

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:03.275
And Kang Jeho.

00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:11.116
From your faces, I see you're the ones.

00:24:09.031 --> 00:24:11.116
From your faces, I see you're the ones.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.911
Who are you, Mister?
You can't just walk in here.

00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:15.371
That goes for you too.

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:17.623
Kim Sangjun, are you the ringleader?

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.542
How do you know my name?

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.542
How do you know my name?

00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:24.713
You're the ones
who falsely accused Mr. Hwang, right?

00:24:24.797 --> 00:24:27.174
No. We were really hit,
so we pressed charges.

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:31.637
Hold on a second.

00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:41.438
<i>If you mess with us, you're done for.</i>

00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:41.438
<i>If you mess with us, you're done for.</i>

00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:43.482
<i>Who are you to lecture us?</i>

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:46.110
<i>Later, Mr. Hwang.</i>
<i>You should've minded your own business.</i>

00:24:47.403 --> 00:24:48.445
Guys.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.199
If you want to commit crimes,
you can't be dumb.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.199
If you want to commit crimes,
you can't be dumb.

00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:54.660
If you're this sloppy now,
how will you manage as adults?

00:24:56.704 --> 00:24:59.707
That's not enough to prove
we made a false accusation.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.459
No, that's not something I have to prove.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.459
No, that's not something I have to prove.

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:05.963
I just need to raise reasonable doubt

00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:08.298
about the actual occurrence
of physical punishment.

00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:11.510
Speaking harshly
is also a form of verbal abuse.

00:25:08.382 --> 00:25:11.510
Speaking harshly
is also a form of verbal abuse.

00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:13.262
Well, you should've reported that then.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.347
Why say he made you lie down
and hit you?

00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:22.229
This gym is supposed to be for students.

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:25.441
So they should let us use it.
Not allowing that is unfair.

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.068
Then you should've filed
an official complaint

00:25:28.152 --> 00:25:29.695
through the proper channels.

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:32.072
You can't make false allegations.
That's a serious crime.

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:32.072
You can't make false allegations.
That's a serious crime.

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.533
What are false allegations?

00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.828
We're too young
to be criminally responsible.

00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.371
Criminally responsible…

00:25:41.123 --> 00:25:43.250
Then, you should've filed charges
under your names.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:46.003
Why drag your parents into this
and turn them into criminals?

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:48.505
And juvenile courts try juveniles.

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.759
Community service, probation,
supervised care, or juvenile detention.

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.759
Community service, probation,
supervised care, or juvenile detention.

00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:55.846
Well, who knows which one you'll get?

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:57.306
How did you find my account?

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.516
There's no way
you could have figured that out.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.101
Why do you think that?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.101
Why do you think that?

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:03.395
I bet you don't even know
what Newstagram is.

00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:11.236
That's a little harsh.

00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:11.236
That's a little harsh.

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:14.573
Ever heard of surfing the net?

00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:17.076
- What's that?
- Not sure.

00:26:17.159 --> 00:26:19.745
- Why would you surf in the winter?
- No idea.

00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:22.706
- This guy is weird.
- I know.

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:26.293
Claiming you don't remember
won't solve everything.

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:29.171
We're not just claiming it.
It's the truth.

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:33.050
You can't answer for the suspect.
You know that.

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:33.050
You can't answer for the suspect.
You know that.

00:26:34.384 --> 00:26:36.929
I really don't remember.
It wasn't at home either.

00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:40.891
Then, I'll show you the footage.

00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:40.891
Then, I'll show you the footage.

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:43.727
Watch and tell us
how much you can remember.

00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:45.604
Please come over here.

00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:54.571
Here.

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:57.866
The victim comes out
of the convenience store.

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:02.037
See the small shopping bag
in his right hand?

00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:02.037
See the small shopping bag
in his right hand?

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.582
- The watch was in that bag?
- Yes.

00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:09.294
In a few moments,
Mr. Moon enters the store.

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:17.845
Then, the victim suddenly
gets up and leaves.

00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.763
He forgets to take the shopping bag.

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:24.893
Then, Mr. Moon comes out
and sits in that spot.

00:27:51.128 --> 00:27:54.631
Okay. Now, he gets up and leaves too.

00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:02.222
Later, the victim comes back,

00:27:59.469 --> 00:28:02.222
Later, the victim comes back,

00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:04.558
but the shopping bag's already gone.

00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:08.312
He reported it to the police right after.

00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.482
Mr. Moon was the only person there
at that time.

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:14.943
So all we can say
is that he put it in his bag.

00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:18.363
But you can't clearly see
the spot from that angle.

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.240
Attorney Kang.

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.240
Attorney Kang.

00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:22.534
You saw the shopping bag, right?

00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:25.037
Besides Mr. Moon, did anyone else come by?

00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.916
I mean, you should deny
what's worth denying.

00:28:36.924 --> 00:28:39.259
Hey, Mom. I just finished the interview.

00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:42.387
I'm not sure how it went.

00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:44.222
Yeah, I had lunch.

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:45.891
Yeah.

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:47.851
Okay, bye.

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:53.357
I told her I was going to an interview.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:58.195
That convenience store's nearby, right?

00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:35.232
What are you looking for?

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:38.360
To install CCTV,
you have to register with the authorities.

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.822
The police likely pulled footage
only from registered CCTVs.

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.822
The police likely pulled footage
only from registered CCTVs.

00:29:42.531 --> 00:29:44.032
So if registering is required,

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:46.451
that implies some may not
have been registered.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.881
That teacher is unbelievable.

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:01.967
He's at fault and yet he hires a lawyer?

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:01.967
He's at fault and yet he hires a lawyer?

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.051
The same goes for you too.

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:07.055
You call yourself a lawyer,
but why are you chasing after our kids?

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:11.184
I mean, you talked to the kids already.
Why did you drag us here?

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:11.184
I mean, you talked to the kids already.
Why did you drag us here?

00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:14.021
You filed the complaint.

00:30:14.104 --> 00:30:17.983
The teachers and the lawyers…
None of them are acting like adults!

00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:21.778
So what is it you want to say?

00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:21.778
So what is it you want to say?

00:30:21.862 --> 00:30:23.864
We're all busy people!

00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:39.296
Excuse me for being late.

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.840
I'm Attorney Bae Munjeong
with Law Group Hyungmin.

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:41.840
I'm Attorney Bae Munjeong
with Law Group Hyungmin.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.468
- What are you doing?
- You looked outnumbered.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.766
Have you decided?
Are you proceeding with the charges?

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.766
Have you decided?
Are you proceeding with the charges?

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:52.100
Come on.

00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:54.394
They said they were hit,
because they were.

00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:56.605
Why would they lie about that?

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.733
And what? False accusation?
You have proof?

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.904
I bet you can't prove it.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.115
You're Im Gihoon's father, right?

00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.868
Yes. How did you know?

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.703
He said the exact same thing.

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.703
He said the exact same thing.

00:31:11.787 --> 00:31:14.831
That's not enough to prove
we made a false accusation.

00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:17.667
The kids have already
come clean at this point.

00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:19.836
If you keep pretending not to know,

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.839
we'll have to consider
how to hold you accountable.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.839
we'll have to consider
how to hold you accountable.

00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:26.510
They lied, not us!
Why are you doing this to us?

00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:28.595
We didn't know it was false!

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:31.306
- It was the kids! Seriously!
- We didn't know!

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:31.306
- It was the kids! Seriously!
- We didn't know!

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:36.436
I asked one of my relatives
who's a chief prosecutor.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.939
And he said if we didn't know,
we're not liable.

00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:41.983
So you're saying

00:31:39.856 --> 00:31:41.983
So you're saying

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:44.653
- the kids are at fault and not you?
- Yes.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.321
Have you ever heard the phrase,

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.157
"law is the moral minimum"?

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.911
Civil law includes something called
supervision liability.

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.911
Civil law includes something called
supervision liability.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.914
As parents of minors,

00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:58.208
you're legally responsible
for their supervision.

00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:01.503
That's the minimum of being a parent.

00:31:59.251 --> 00:32:01.503
That's the minimum of being a parent.

00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:04.422
But you say,
"The kids did it and I had no idea"?

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.888
If you won't take
moral responsibility as parents,

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.888
If you won't take
moral responsibility as parents,

00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:14.641
you'll be held legally responsible
for their supervision.

00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:16.184
- My goodness.
- Wait.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.439
Then, what should we do
to make this right?

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.439
Then, what should we do
to make this right?

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:23.066
You're lawyers,

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.652
so advise us.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.530
We represent Mr. Hwang.

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.574
We are not your attorneys.

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:30.574
We are not your attorneys.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.454
First, you should drop the charges.

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.541
After that, it's up to Mr. Hwang.

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:40.917
So, what would you like to do?

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:40.917
So, what would you like to do?

00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:47.382
We should drop the charges.

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:48.550
I don't know.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.014
Hey.

00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:56.391
Why were you so worked up?
You startled me.

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:59.603
They had no idea they were wrong
but came in like an angry mob.

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:00.979
I couldn't stand it.

00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:00.979
I couldn't stand it.

00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:05.066
You need to have your head on straight
to not end up like those parents.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:09.279
Anyway, what time
and where are we meeting?

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:11.072
I'll text you.

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:11.072
I'll text you.

00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:15.076
- Should we invite Huiji?
- Yeah, I'll reach out.

00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.246
You let Jiseok know.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.372
You do it. It's your husband.

00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:22.209
He's your friend too, Attorney Ahn.

00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:22.209
He's your friend too, Attorney Ahn.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:26.171
I'm Attorney Kang Huiji.

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:31.259
Still, I can't.

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:33.762
We'll take a really quick look
at just that time frame.

00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:36.014
You're a lawyer. Don't you know the law?

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:38.850
I can't just show this stuff
without the police.

00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:41.895
Actually, if someone who was filmed asks,
you need to show it.

00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:41.895
Actually, if someone who was filmed asks,
you need to show it.

00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:44.981
My goodness.

00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:48.443
Excuse me for saying this
right off the bat,

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:50.237
but I have a criminal record.

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:50.237
but I have a criminal record.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.573
So I'm trying to stay within the law now.

00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:55.825
So go talk to the police,

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:58.870
and unless they say so,
I'm not showing anything.

00:33:58.954 --> 00:34:00.163
Got it?

00:33:58.954 --> 00:34:00.163
Got it?

00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:01.289
Goodbye.

00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:03.458
- But… Sir!
- Wait…

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:15.971
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:15.971
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:18.348
What do we do, Attorney Kang?

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:22.602
- Are you sure the watch isn't at home?
- Yes.

00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:28.942
Then, let's check the footage
with the police.

00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:34.864
But what if…

00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:37.534
we check the footage,

00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.705
and it turns out I really did take it?

00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.705
and it turns out I really did take it?

00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:50.213
- It doesn't smell too bad.
- It does.

00:34:48.962 --> 00:34:50.213
- It doesn't smell too bad.
- It does.

00:34:50.297 --> 00:34:51.756
I washed it in the laundry.

00:34:53.967 --> 00:34:55.260
In any case…

00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:57.220
Good job. It smells like herbs.

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.599
Could we have another glass?

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.599
Could we have another glass?

00:35:00.682 --> 00:35:01.891
Huiji can't make it.

00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:03.685
I guess she's busy with work.

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:05.520
Really?

00:35:06.313 --> 00:35:08.481
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:27.626
You never ask for favors,

00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:29.586
but why drag me out
in the middle of the night?

00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:31.338
That's why I'm buying you dinner.

00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:31.338
That's why I'm buying you dinner.

00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:32.881
You live right next door too.

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.049
Exactly.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:37.427
And you've never once dropped by
even though I've invited you.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.846
It's no fun drinking with you.

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:40.972
Zero fun.

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:40.972
Zero fun.

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:43.725
How ridiculous…

00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:48.730
Unbelievable.

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:57.072
By the way, why aren't you eating?

00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:58.782
What? I'm just…

00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:00.283
not hungry.

00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:00.283
not hungry.

00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:02.494
Really? That's not like you.

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:07.123
Hey, did you hear from Juhwan?

00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:10.418
He said he's being sued,
so I gave him your number.

00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:10.418
He said he's being sued,
so I gave him your number.

00:36:10.502 --> 00:36:11.878
Yeah, I'm taking his case.

00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:15.382
You? That's a first.
You never handle your friends' cases.

00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:18.468
Well, we're not close. I just know of him.

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:20.553
Do you go around
telling people we're close?

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:20.553
Do you go around
telling people we're close?

00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:24.015
No, but don't get in trouble.
I won't take your case.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.645
My wife's a lawyer too.
Why would I go to you? Right?

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:31.147
I'd be glad if he did
get into trouble for once.

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:31.147
I'd be glad if he did
get into trouble for once.

00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:32.315
You're so boring.

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.527
That was very hurtful, you know.
The both of you.

00:36:36.778 --> 00:36:39.030
By the way, have you had
any blind dates lately?

00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:40.448
I'm too busy.

00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:40.448
I'm too busy.

00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:42.283
What do you mean "busy"?

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:44.202
You had time to visit
the kids' school today.

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:45.495
I went there for work.

00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:47.080
School? Why?

00:36:47.163 --> 00:36:49.541
Well, there were these little rugrats

00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:52.127
who falsely accused their teacher
of corporal punishment.

00:36:49.624 --> 00:36:52.127
who falsely accused their teacher
of corporal punishment.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.796
My goodness. That's terrifying.

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.798
That would make me
too scared to have kids.

00:36:57.382 --> 00:36:58.383
Geez.

00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:05.432
- So did it get resolved?
- Yeah, I think it will.

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:07.308
It's a relief, I suppose.

00:37:08.351 --> 00:37:09.352
What's a relief?

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:13.815
Well, my client
wasn't some terrible person.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.444
Why does that matter to you?

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.989
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.989
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.449
Who are you?

00:37:22.532 --> 00:37:24.159
Where has Juhyeong gone?
Are you sick?

00:37:24.951 --> 00:37:26.494
- He's being weird.
- He was always weird.

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.663
- He's even weirder today.
- I think so too.

00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:30.623
I'm so full.

00:37:29.622 --> 00:37:30.623
I'm so full.

00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:32.292
Thanks for the food!

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:33.460
- Thanks.
- Get home safe!

00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:47.140
My client's not some terrible person.
That's such a relief.

00:37:47.682 --> 00:37:49.768
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

00:37:51.853 --> 00:37:54.481
It's always better
if they turn out to be decent.

00:38:12.332 --> 00:38:13.374
Seriously.

00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:16.377
Attorney Cho.

00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:18.254
Want to hear something funny?

00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.048
What is it?

00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:20.048
What is it?

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.216
Do you know

00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:23.927
why my dad stuck you with me?

00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:27.388
Well, to keep you entertained.

00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.058
You're so funny.

00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.058
You're so funny.

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.810
You're so naive.

00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.562
He sent you to keep an eye on me.

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:36.439
He's worried I might rat him out.

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:40.401
- Sorry?
- How do you think I got all my money?

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:40.401
- Sorry?
- How do you think I got all my money?

00:38:40.485 --> 00:38:41.778
It's all from that geezer.

00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:44.030
But man, that old geezer…

00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:46.241
is such a coward.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:49.160
Why would I rat on him?
I'll be out in no time.

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:50.995
I've read some of your case files.

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:50.995
I've read some of your case files.

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:53.456
It might be tough to get released soon.

00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:56.626
You want to bet?

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:58.086
To see if I get out or not?

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:02.549
I'm not supposed to
tell anyone about this.

00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:05.009
This tip's worth hundreds
of millions of won.

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:07.929
Geez.

00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:10.974
In stock manipulation cases,

00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:10.974
In stock manipulation cases,

00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:13.643
it comes down
to who took the unfair gains…

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:16.729
No.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.607
Want to work for me after I get out?

00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:21.067
I'll tell you then.

00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:21.067
I'll tell you then.

00:39:22.694 --> 00:39:26.072
I mean, you're already getting paid
to hang out with me.

00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:28.449
Instead of pretending to be a lawyer,

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:31.703
you can just hang with me
while on my payroll.

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:31.703
you can just hang with me
while on my payroll.

00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:33.663
It'll be fun.

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:39.043
Why would I ever work for you?

00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:42.755
What's with that look?

00:39:44.424 --> 00:39:47.135
Does showing off that look full of pride

00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:48.845
make you feel better?

00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:51.848
I don't need to show off
for a lowlife like you.

00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:51.848
I don't need to show off
for a lowlife like you.

00:39:52.765 --> 00:39:55.810
You're going to rot in here
for the next 10 to 20 years.

00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.605
For a punk who's not even
getting out of here,

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:01.900
you sure like to run your mouth
about who'd work for you.

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:01.900
you sure like to run your mouth
about who'd work for you.

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.989
If I'm a lowlife,

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.491
then what does that make
someone entertaining me like you?

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.491
then what does that make
someone entertaining me like you?

00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:16.247
You'll be back in a few days anyway,

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.001
so drop the pride.

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.001
so drop the pride.

00:40:20.627 --> 00:40:22.253
You'll only hurt yourself.

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:46.778
<i>Thank you, Attorney Ahn.</i>

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.072
<i>I'll work hard to teach the kids right.</i>

00:40:51.658 --> 00:40:52.951
Talking to a girl?

00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:55.536
- You scared me!
- Why did you smile at that text?

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.580
It's nothing. Let's go.

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:00.917
- Was it really a girl?
- No, it wasn't. Let's go.

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:00.917
- Was it really a girl?
- No, it wasn't. Let's go.

00:41:01.542 --> 00:41:02.543
Have a good lunch.

00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:03.878
- You too.
- Thank you.

00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:05.922
- What are you eating?
<i>- Malatang.</i>

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:07.799
That's a good choice.

00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:11.302
What are we eating?

00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:11.302
What are we eating?

00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:14.097
I don't know.

00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:22.897
- Off for lunch?
- Of course.

00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:24.440
You're not coming?

00:41:24.524 --> 00:41:26.734
I think I'll have to eat on my own today.

00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.488
That wasn't mentioned in the group text.

00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:30.488
That wasn't mentioned in the group text.

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.699
Why are you arguing? She must be busy.

00:41:33.366 --> 00:41:35.410
- No, I…
- Juhyeong,

00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:36.953
I'm a busy person too.

00:41:45.294 --> 00:41:48.506
- I'll head out first.
- Okay, take care. Make sure you eat.

00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:49.632
Okay!

00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:56.973
What?

00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:58.933
I knew it.

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:08.776
What?

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:11.195
I think we should have cold noodles.

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:11.195
I think we should have cold noodles.

00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:13.239
- Sure.
- Today's cold noodles day.

00:42:13.322 --> 00:42:14.532
Okay, cold noodles.

00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:21.497
- Okay, enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:42:19.412 --> 00:42:21.497
- Okay, enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:22.623
Of course.

00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:24.167
- Are you leaving? Okay.
- Yes.

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:29.505
Thank you. Come again.

00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:30.798
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:30.798
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:37.013
Sir, this<i> jajangmyeon</i>'s really good.

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.600
Our black bean paste is pretty unique.

00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.600
Our black bean paste is pretty unique.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:43.311
I still can't show you the footage.

00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:46.606
I'll only look at where my client appears.
That'll be enough.

00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:48.608
And I've told you enough times.

00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:49.984
Come back with the police.

00:42:58.659 --> 00:42:59.911
This is good.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.212
- Move the radish salad.
- Come on.

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:12.799
Nice. I got it.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.137
Who eats cold noodles in the winter?

00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:20.098
Cold noodles are originally
from a cold region.

00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:20.098
Cold noodles are originally
from a cold region.

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:22.642
Even people in cold regions
don't eat this in the winter.

00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:25.853
You don't drink iced coffee
but eat cold noodles in the winter?

00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:28.356
Munjeong said she was really craving it.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.650
She's always really craving something.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.650
She's always really craving something.

00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:34.487
Then, get <i>galbitang.</i>
Why do you complain so much when we eat?

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.280
I can't be the only one
to order <i>galbitang.</i>

00:43:36.864 --> 00:43:37.990
That's true.

00:43:40.201 --> 00:43:42.203
- Hey, one cold noodles, please.
- Okay.

00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:45.581
Hello? What's up?

00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:48.668
Yeah, I work for Law Group Hyungmin.

00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:50.878
Kang Huiji?

00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:50.878
Kang Huiji?

00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:54.257
Of course, I know her well. Why?

00:43:56.092 --> 00:43:59.595
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

00:44:04.183 --> 00:44:05.893
Geez. Hey.

00:44:06.686 --> 00:44:08.479
I called you to stop her from coming.

00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.314
- Why did you come with her?
- What?

00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.314
- Why did you come with her?
- What?

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.567
It's been a while since I've seen you.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.819
- You two must be really close.
- I'm a regular.

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:16.737
He always brings girls here to woo them.

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:18.406
- Then, he became a regular.
- Hey!

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.741
Why would you say that?
She'll get the wrong idea.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.741
Why would you say that?
She'll get the wrong idea.

00:44:20.825 --> 00:44:23.244
What? Why are you flustered?
You're really wooing her?

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:25.329
What are you talking about?
You're so weird.

00:44:26.873 --> 00:44:29.000
But what do you do to woo them?

00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:30.751
Well, that…

00:44:29.709 --> 00:44:30.751
Well, that…

00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:33.337
is a trade secret.

00:44:33.421 --> 00:44:34.422
What a load of crap.

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.549
If I say no, it means no.

00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:39.594
But since you're here with Changwon,
enjoy your meal.

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:41.679
I'll give you some mayo shrimp
on the house.

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:41.679
I'll give you some mayo shrimp
on the house.

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:43.764
Thank you. I'll be back often.

00:44:45.933 --> 00:44:47.101
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:49.061
- See you later.
- See you later!

00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:03.284
Thank you for waiting.

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:06.954
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:08.748
It's so good.

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.499
Geez, they're so annoying.

00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:10.499
Geez, they're so annoying.

00:45:20.343 --> 00:45:23.554
It's burnt.
I can't post photos of burnt meat.

00:45:23.638 --> 00:45:24.639
- No, wait…
- Not this one.

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:28.017
- It's because I was waiting for you.
- But this meat doesn't look good.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.560
- Cook me a new piece.
- Okay.

00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.604
- A new one.
- It's frozen.

00:45:31.687 --> 00:45:32.813
Nice. The lighting's perfect.

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:33.981
- Done.
- Done?

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:35.107
Okay.

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.366
- Sorry.
- Was that revenge?

00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:45.701
- I'm eating the burnt ones for you.
- Okay.

00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:52.667
Goodness.

00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:54.293
Here's your fried rice.

00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:58.798
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.513
Stop smiling.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.306
Why not?

00:46:13.062 --> 00:46:16.816
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

00:46:20.987 --> 00:46:22.113
Goodness.

00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:26.075
I feel like it might work
if we go just one more time.

00:46:26.158 --> 00:46:28.119
Right? One more time and we could puke.

00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.122
These darn convenience store tables.

00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.122
These darn convenience store tables.

00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:32.957
Why did they have to leave it here?

00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.752
Still, you're seriously a committed one.

00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:39.880
Sorry for dragging you in.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.507
No, it's okay.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.094
Following you around makes me feel
like I'm working hard too.

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:46.429
It's fun. I like it.

00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:48.139
Really?

00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:50.683
Then, does this feel worth doing?

00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:50.683
Then, does this feel worth doing?

00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:52.727
You said you wanted some exciting work.

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.271
Well…

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.440
This is way better than what I'm doing.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.818
I think

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.818
I think

00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:03.446
I'm not cut out to be a lawyer.

00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:05.948
Why? You're the one
who loves coming to work the most.

00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:09.493
That's just because you guys are here.
That's why I enjoy it.

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:11.162
The job itself is…

00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:12.705
I'm not sure about it.

00:47:12.788 --> 00:47:17.001
Still, if you ever quit,
you can take over your father's business.

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.336
Come on.

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:21.297
It's his company, not mine.
I've told you a million times.

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:21.297
It's his company, not mine.
I've told you a million times.

00:47:22.048 --> 00:47:24.216
What about your dad?
You said he runs a business too.

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:25.968
Yeah.

00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:28.137
Just a second.

00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:30.306
Hey, Dad.

00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:30.306
Hey, Dad.

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.143
No, I didn't forget.
We talked about it last time.

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:38.105
Next Friday…

00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:41.442
Okay. Bye.

00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:41.442
Okay. Bye.

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.030
What? You have plans next Friday?

00:47:46.113 --> 00:47:48.074
Yeah, my parents' memorial rites.

00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:49.992
What?

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:52.620
What? What is it?

00:47:54.163 --> 00:47:55.164
Wait.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.875
Just now on the phone,

00:47:58.584 --> 00:48:00.294
didn't you say "Dad"?

00:47:58.584 --> 00:48:00.294
didn't you say "Dad"?

00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:01.962
Yeah, I was talking to my dad.

00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:06.008
So…

00:48:06.092 --> 00:48:08.302
- Your mother's memorial rites?
- No, my parents'.

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.054
What?

00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:10.054
What?

00:48:12.056 --> 00:48:16.852
My parents passed away when I was seven,
so my aunt and uncle raised me.

00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:19.438
My uncle's basically my dad.

00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:23.859
I see.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:26.737
Then…

00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:32.993
So the dad who runs a business
is your uncle, who was just on the phone.

00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:32.993
So the dad who runs a business
is your uncle, who was just on the phone.

00:48:33.661 --> 00:48:35.454
No, wait. He's your dad.

00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:39.667
No, your dad passed away, so…

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:40.751
What?

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:40.751
What?

00:48:42.545 --> 00:48:45.172
Tough, right? It's okay.
You don't have to say anything.

00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:46.715
No, still…

00:48:46.799 --> 00:48:48.300
I feel like

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.594
I should say something.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.594
I should say something.

00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:52.179
No, just relax.

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:54.140
Is that okay?

00:48:54.223 --> 00:48:56.559
Yeah, just relax. I'm fine.

00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.311
Thanks.

00:49:32.344 --> 00:49:33.554
SCHOLARSHIP RECOMMENDATION

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:36.348
This year's candidates
have been narrowed down to five.

00:49:36.432 --> 00:49:39.143
Four high school seniors
and one student on a gap year.

00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:43.981
This student's reported parental income
fluctuates a lot from year to year.

00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:47.943
Do another background check to see
whether it's been underreported

00:49:48.027 --> 00:49:49.820
compared to actual income.

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:52.448
- Then, I'll make a final decision.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:52.448
- Then, I'll make a final decision.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:55.701
Chairman, Lee Dongsu
from the first cohort…

00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:56.827
Again?

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:01.749
And the victim?

00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:03.792
He hasn't hired a lawyer yet, right?

00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:05.961
No, he's handling the case alone.

00:50:08.506 --> 00:50:11.008
Should we cover
the victim's legal fees again?

00:50:08.506 --> 00:50:11.008
Should we cover
the victim's legal fees again?

00:50:12.343 --> 00:50:13.344
No.

00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:16.597
This time,
let's not just cover the legal fees.

00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.433
Bring him here instead.

00:50:21.143 --> 00:50:23.062
This is Law Group Hyungmin.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.273
Let's represent the victim ourselves.

00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:30.444
It's what I always wanted to do
if I ever got to form a law group.

00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:30.444
It's what I always wanted to do
if I ever got to form a law group.

00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:31.570
Yes, ma'am.

00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:40.120
- Hey.
- Welcome--

00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:40.120
- Hey.
- Welcome--

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.916
Seriously.

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:45.584
I've had it with you two.

00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:47.002
Come on.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.507
You sure it's okay to show you this?

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.507
You sure it's okay to show you this?

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.886
I'm sure of it! You can show it
as long as no one else is seen.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.304
But tell that kid to come.

00:50:57.388 --> 00:50:59.348
- Doesn't he live around here anyway?
- Yes!

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:01.934
If I get in trouble, it's on you.

00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:04.937
- Come on, man. We're lawyers.
- And I'm an ex-convict.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.522
- I'll represent you.
- Deal.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.496
My goodness.

00:52:05.414 --> 00:52:07.625
Why did you do that?

00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:31.190
I can't get a job.

00:52:34.568 --> 00:52:36.654
I got drunk and stole someone's stuff.

00:52:41.617 --> 00:52:44.161
Man, I'm absolute trash.

00:52:52.086 --> 00:52:58.634
GEUMSEONG RESTAURANT

00:53:05.307 --> 00:53:07.476
What do I do now, Attorney Kang?

00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:09.520
You have to pretend not to know.

00:53:12.064 --> 00:53:14.400
That's what I have to say as your lawyer.

00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:18.696
With just the police's CCTV footage,
it'll be hard to prove anything.

00:53:18.779 --> 00:53:19.863
But…

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.992
if I were your older sister,

00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:28.997
I'd tell you to take that footage
to the police yourself.

00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:37.589
If you're already beating yourself up
for being unemployed and stealing,

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:43.095
how will you live with yourself
if you also lie and hide this?

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:43.095
how will you live with yourself
if you also lie and hide this?

00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:48.392
Getting cleared won't make
what you did wrong disappear.

00:53:56.024 --> 00:53:58.819
That's a 2,668 percent increase
in the estimated statement.

00:54:04.116 --> 00:54:06.744
What's going on?
Why are you gathered like it was planned?

00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:09.288
Hey! Did you…

00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:12.875
- Did you get together without me?
- We ran into each other by chance.

00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:12.875
- Did you get together without me?
- We ran into each other by chance.

00:54:12.958 --> 00:54:15.461
- For real?
- Is this <i>kimbap?</i>

00:54:15.544 --> 00:54:17.463
- Ouch.
- I had so much greasy food lately.

00:54:17.546 --> 00:54:18.964
I need something spicy.

00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:20.090
Eat up, you punk.

00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:20.090
Eat up, you punk.

00:54:20.174 --> 00:54:21.341
Spicy…

00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:24.762
<i>Spicy pepper </i>kimbap<i>.</i>

00:54:24.845 --> 00:54:27.556
Spicy pepper <i>kimbap</i>?
There are two rolls. Give me one.

00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:29.516
- Ouch!
- Hands off. It's Huiji's.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.226
I thought she might need this too.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.226
I thought she might need this too.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:32.978
Munjeong needs one too.

00:54:33.061 --> 00:54:34.104
What about Sanggi?

00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:35.689
Get one yourselves.

00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:40.486
Since we're all here

00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:40.486
Since we're all here

00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:43.697
and we haven't hung out in a while,
let's set a date.

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:47.159
Well, how about next Friday?

00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:48.577
- That works.
- Sounds good.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.828
It works for me.

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:52.789
- But it won't work for Huiji.
- Really?

00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:55.292
- And how do you know this?
- She just has things to do.

00:54:55.375 --> 00:54:57.211
Because of that CCTV footage?

00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.462
She's done with that.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.883
- But she just has things to do.
- Okay, how about tonight then?

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.883
- But she just has things to do.
- Okay, how about tonight then?

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.801
- Tonight sounds good too.
- Me too.

00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:06.929
- Tonight won't work either.
- You or Huiji?

00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:09.723
- Both of us.
- Geez, when can we hang out then?

00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:14.561
Hey, you said you had a trial. Go on.

00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:17.272
- Okay.
- I'll put up a poll in the group text.

00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:18.357
What case is this?

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.652
This is Munjeong's case.
I was helping out for 10,000 won.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.652
This is Munjeong's case.
I was helping out for 10,000 won.

00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:23.779
Hey! I said that's for Huiji!

00:55:25.864 --> 00:55:27.282
What's his deal?

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.660
Geez, I can't do this.

00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:33.413
Munjeong, take this back.
I can't do this for just 10,000 won.

00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:33.413
Munjeong, take this back.
I can't do this for just 10,000 won.

00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:34.498
Why not, Attorney Ha?

00:55:34.581 --> 00:55:37.167
A 150-page summary
for 10,000 won is ridiculous.

00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:40.128
- No refunds.
- Give me another 10,000 won, please.

00:55:37.251 --> 00:55:40.128
- No refunds.
- Give me another 10,000 won, please.

00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:42.256
- Just 10,000 won more.
- Just have some <i>kimbap.</i>

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:43.840
Just an extra 10,000 won!

00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.440
Hello, Mr. Na.

00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.440
Hello, Mr. Na.

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:02.985
<i>- You're not in court today, right?</i>
- That's right.

00:56:03.068 --> 00:56:05.779
I just got a call that my kid's hurt,
so I rushed out.

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:08.323
But I totally forgot
that I had a trial to attend.

00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:10.826
Could you cover for me?

00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:10.826
Could you cover for me?

00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:12.286
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:13.537
What time is the trial?

00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:15.163
<i>It's at 4:00 p.m.</i>

00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:19.585
It's 3:50 p.m. right now.

00:56:19.668 --> 00:56:21.503
If you run, you'll make it in time.

00:56:19.668 --> 00:56:21.503
If you run, you'll make it in time.

00:56:21.587 --> 00:56:24.464
Okay, I'll hang up now.

00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:25.757
<i>All right. Sorry.</i>

00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:29.553
Damn it.

00:56:33.098 --> 00:56:34.099
Damn it!

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.435
Attorney Bae!

00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:38.937
Thank you! Sorry!

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:00.959
The plaintiff, Pungcheon Trading Company.
Are you present?

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:00.959
The plaintiff, Pungcheon Trading Company.
Are you present?

00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:05.255
Plaintiff? Pungcheon Trading Company?

00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:07.716
- Yes, I'm here.
- Yes, please step forward.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.469
The defendant, Century International.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.469
The defendant, Century International.

00:57:11.136 --> 00:57:12.220
Present.

00:57:13.055 --> 00:57:16.975
Okay, the plaintiff submitted their brief
during yesterday's session.

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:19.853
We'll begin
as soon as everything is ready.

00:57:52.344 --> 00:57:54.763
<i>Hello, this is ON OB-GYN Clinic.</i>

00:57:54.846 --> 00:57:56.515
<i>For appointments and inquiries--</i>

00:57:57.015 --> 00:58:00.185
<i>- Hello, this is ON OB-GYN Clinic.</i>
- Hello.

00:57:57.015 --> 00:58:00.185
<i>- Hello, this is ON OB-GYN Clinic.</i>
- Hello.

00:58:00.268 --> 00:58:02.688
I was wondering
if I could make an appointment?

00:58:05.023 --> 00:58:07.067
The Chinese restaurant across the street?

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.194
Yes, they have a private CCTV.

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.453
It captured everything
without any blind spots.

00:58:18.537 --> 00:58:19.538
Really?

00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:23.667
Then, who was the culprit?

00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:27.087
- It was me.
- What?

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.881
Yes, my client took it with him.

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.092
I see.

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.722
Then, I'll find out
how we'll proceed with this.

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:39.307
This will count as turning himself in.

00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:41.935
But honestly,
I don't know where the watch is.

00:58:39.391 --> 00:58:41.935
But honestly,
I don't know where the watch is.

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.103
I don't even remember.

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:45.939
I might've dropped it somewhere.
But I'll make up for it somehow.

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.899
Okay. I'll talk to the victim about that.

00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:51.403
Don't worry too much.

00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:53.405
It wasn't that expensive.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.532
I see. Thank you.

00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:07.627
I guess you didn't tell your mom
it was an interview this time?

00:59:07.711 --> 00:59:08.712
That's right.

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.630
What did you tell her?

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.630
What did you tell her?

00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:14.551
I said I was going to the police station.

00:59:15.635 --> 00:59:16.636
Good job.

00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:19.848
Thank you, Attorney Kang.

00:59:21.683 --> 00:59:23.643
You might as well call me your big sister

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.438
since you took her advice
and not your lawyer's.

00:59:26.521 --> 00:59:27.814
Right. Okay.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:29.816
Let's go.

00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:42.621
- I'm buying to show thanks. Let me grill.
- It's okay.

00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:42.621
- I'm buying to show thanks. Let me grill.
- It's okay.

00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:44.080
I just want to eat quickly.

00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:50.962
I was pretty bummed last time
when they went to eat barbecue without us.

00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:50.962
I was pretty bummed last time
when they went to eat barbecue without us.

00:59:51.046 --> 00:59:56.343
That's why I said I'd treat you today.
You missed out because of me.

00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.637
Still, it all worked out.

00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.139
That guy's braver than he looks.

00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.139
That guy's braver than he looks.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:02.682
Yeah, I know.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.559
This looks ready. Dig in.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.521
Hold on!

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.398
Excuse me! One bottle of soju, please!

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.398
Excuse me! One bottle of soju, please!

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.785
I don't want to go to work.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:22.869
Why not?

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:28.750
I just blew up at someone I hate
like I'd never see them again.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.335
But I'll have to see him soon.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.335
But I'll have to see him soon.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.087
Maybe even tomorrow.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:36.967
You must really hate it.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.056
Did you understand what I meant?

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.476
Not really,

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.604
but it felt like
you didn't want to say any more.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:00.824
Actually…

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:00.824
Actually…

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.244
I've been doing prison visitations lately.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:06.955
- Prison visitations?
- Yeah.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.042
I'm not even representing him.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.042
I'm not even representing him.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.754
Just keeping him company every day
is so exhausting.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.923
Why would they make you do that?

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.093
That's why you've had that moody face?

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.093
That's why you've had that moody face?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.474
How much longer do you have to go?

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.643
I have no idea
and not knowing that

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.645
is the hardest part.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.645
is the hardest part.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.825
Cheers.

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.675
Should we get more spicy cold noodles?

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.675
Should we get more spicy cold noodles?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.762
Sure. Ma'am!

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:05.639
One spicy cold noodles, please.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:06.848
Okay.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.692
Excuse me. We're ready to order here.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:19.486
- Over here, please.
- Okay.

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.404
Thank you.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.032
Okay.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.701
As you get older,
you need to warm eat foods.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:29.037
You can't eat that cold stuff.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.248
This has been my favorite spot for ages.
Please enjoy.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.248

Anyways, thanks to you,
our company has grown so much.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.965
Business is definitely better.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.424
We're truly grateful!

01:02:43.218 --> 01:02:44.469
- You're welcome.
- All right.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:46.930
Three pieces of meat.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.473
Gosh, three pieces.

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:52.143
- Have some.
- Thank you.

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:54.020
Thank you.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:01.152
By the way,
why did you want to meet today?

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:01.152
By the way,
why did you want to meet today?

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.071
I'm actually pretty busy.

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:05.782
Right.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:10.745
Since you're all busy,
I'll cut to the chase.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:10.745
Since you're all busy,
I'll cut to the chase.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.708
I'd like to ask you to take a case.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.462
It's not a case that I'm involved in.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:22.132
It's just a referral,
so please don't feel pressured.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:22.132
It's just a referral,
so please don't feel pressured.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:25.969
Take on a case?

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.053
Yes.

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.931
Out of this group,

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.434
I was hoping two of you could take it.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:36.312
Ms. Kim said she's too busy,

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:41.484
and Mr. Seong said
his business is already doing so well.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:41.484
and Mr. Seong said
his business is already doing so well.

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:47.365
So I was thinking Mr. Na
and Ms. Kang could handle this one.

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:51.202
Us two?

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:52.370
I mean,

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.456
we're not doing <i>that</i> well.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.540
I see.

01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:57.167
So there are two cases?

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.877
No, just one.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.004
Just one? Then, why both of us?

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.004
Just one? Then, why both of us?

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:04.215
I want you two to work on it together.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.093
That's the only condition I'm asking of.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.803
I like collaborative cases.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.639
I see. It's all right, Mr. Seong.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.639
I see. It's all right, Mr. Seong.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:14.225
Since we're now one firm,

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:16.644
how about taking this chance
to collaborate?

01:04:16.728 --> 01:04:18.772
That way,
I'll know the merger was worth it.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.356
Together?

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.356
Together?

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.193
Think it over as you eat.

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:29.949
Why aren't you eating the rice?

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.659
I've stopped eating carbs.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:34.621
I see.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.641
You're getting out late.

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:56.226
Yes.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.020
Witness examination?

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.147
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.

01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.147
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.363
Did that CCTV footage case wrap up okay?

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:12.659
We checked
and it turned out my client did take it.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:12.659
We checked
and it turned out my client did take it.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.453
But he came clean and apologized.

01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:18.957
It was just a mistake.
He wasn't a bad person.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.918
Nice work. That's a relief.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.170
Right?

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.053
Why don't you have a meal with me?

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:33.888
- Sorry?
- It's just…

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.809
Didn't you promise to buy me a meal?

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.187
For Ku Dongkyun's case?

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.187
For Ku Dongkyun's case?

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:43.773
Of course, I will.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:46.317
Were you upset that I didn't?

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:49.195
I'm not upset. It's just…

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.698
A promise is a promise.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.283
Okay, I'll treat you.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:55.785
Think about what you'd like.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:57.745
Okay.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.020

WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.600
I...

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.600
with Hiroko-san...

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.600
we haven't done that kind of thing.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.000
We should become a real couple, too.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.700
It's a festival!!!

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.300
Oh no, did I let her drink too much?!

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.600
I think we need to become a real couple.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.420
For real?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.080
Did my determination get through to you?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.700
Good morning, Hiroko-san.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.800
Now, the relationship between
Hiroko-san and me is bound to change!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Hiroko-san?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.800
I'm going to pack my things.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.600
I have a meeting to attend,
so I'm heading out now.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
Hiroko-san, take care on your way.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
I'm heading out.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
Huh?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
A kiss...?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.700
"AYAKA is in LOVE with HIROKO 2nd Stage"

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.030
Huh?

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.300
(Episode 3: Getting jealous is so childish)
Has Hiroko-senpai always been like this?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
Yeah.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.100
Even when I'm sleeping...

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.600
Hiroko-san.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.800
Good night.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800
Good night.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.200
The kiss that kept me going
from morning till night is gone!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.209
But I still think you two are pretty close.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.340
Even though that's true, I still
feel like I'm being brushed off a little.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.000
And her smile is a little strange, too.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.500
Everything else seems normal, right?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.800
Not just normal, it's absolutely perfect.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.500
Just like the attentive service
of a top-class hotel hostess!

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.800
Is this... is this a hotel breakfast?!

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
She's way busier at work than I am.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.440
I don't think you need to worry so much.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.740
Is that so?

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.989
Yeah, when things get busy, it's only natural
that there's less time for close interactions.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.510
No, that's not right. Everything
just happened all of a sudden.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600
We used to be so happy.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.000
Could it be...

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.900
This is what they call the slump phase.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.019
A rough patch?

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.270
What should I do, Risa! What if
Hiroko-san ends up disliking me!

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.479
Calm down, Ayaka!

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.590
But Hiroko-san is different
from me. She's a real veteran!

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.500
Hiroko-san was my first
love. I really don't get it at allâ€¦

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.800
Maybe it's better to ask
the seniors after all, right?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800
Huh?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.170
Ah! Welcome!

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.700
Ayaka-chan, Risa-chan.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.500
Sorry to interrupt!

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.309
You still carry yourself with that
same samurai spirit as always.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.600
So bold!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.560
I have something I'd like
to ask everyone today.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.300
You can ask anything.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.100
Is this the start of the slump?

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.810
If it's a rough patch.

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:56.300
Most of the time, yes...

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.500
Everything gets turned upside down?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.460
Turn everything upside down?!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.699
They start talking less,
and their attitude gets colder.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.900
Running off to someone else.
The worst-case scenario would be breaking up, right?

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.000
Break up?!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
Yeah, there are people like that too!

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.090
I'm totally devoted to my
darling Risa. Don't worry~

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.700
I know, I know.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.300
But I don't think Hiroko
would ever get tired of Ayaka.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.386
Before we even started dating, she kept going on
and on about her subordinates, it was so annoying.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.600
She's never dated anyone as
long as she has with Ayaka-chan.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Really?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.700
- Because Hiroko...
- She only ever goes for short-term flings...

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.489
Even if they broke up
because of a rough patch,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.000
They might even get back together
because of some small chance.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.000
At the end of the day, the people who come to
bars like this, it's really just a small circle.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.570
That's right, the lesbian bar
scene is actually pretty small.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Really that small?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.176
Your ex-girlfriend's ex-girlfriend is also your
ex-girlfriend's ex-girlfriend, that's normal.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
Hey!!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.800
So if you mess around everywhere, things
will get completely out of hand later.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.700
Oh, come on, Risa, baby! I really
won't do that kind of thing ever again!

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200
Really?

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.100
Of course!

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.600
So please don't be mad anymore, okay?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500
Don't ignore me, I'm sorry.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.967
Being totally controlled.

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:30.800
Risa-chan, you're amazing
for being able to handle Kyoko.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Um...

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.600
Does that kind of conflict
only happen between women?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.278
Of course, it also depends on the person,

00:06:40.303 --> 00:06:44.638
but if someone blurs the line between love and
friendship, conflicts can definitely happen.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.000
Some couples even end up in a mess because of
jealousy and wanting to possess each other.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.700
A complete mess...

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.500
But I think Hiro-chan
will be just fine, don't you?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.700
She really cares about Ayaka-chan.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.886
By the way, are you two going
through a rough patch right now?

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.700
I honestly couldn't tell at all.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.800
I don't knowâ€¦

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.999
Back at the hot spring resort in Hawaii, I really
thought things were going smoothly between us...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.800
Huh?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.600
Things are going great!

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.800
Congratulations!

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.400
Thank you!

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.640
That was the best feeling ever!

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.399
Hey! Come on, tell us all about it and more details!

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.799
Hey, Kyoko-san! That's way too personal!

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800
What does it matter?

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:32.300
This was the night when Hiroko embraced the
pure-hearted Ayaka-chan-definitely a night to remember!

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
Well...

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.300
My whole body was caressed so smoothly, it felt amazing!

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.000
Hiroko-san's hand gently caressed my leg.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.900
Starting from my calf, her hand
slowly moved up to my thigh.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.000
My heart's racing now.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.000
And then her hand slid down to my waist.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.200
Hiroko-san...

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.600
Sometimes it's an intense sensation,
and other times it's a gentle caress.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.500
Hm?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.000
And then slowly move
upward toward the neck.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.140
Gentle yet intense.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.700
That feels so good there.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Got a good squeeze!

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.980
That is...

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.000
Finally, Hiroko-san's hand
gently caressed my cheek.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.970
Hiroko-san.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.300
I...

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.000
So happy...

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.900
I... I didn't know because
it was my first time...

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.800
So that's what it feels like, it's so comfortable!

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.900
The swelling in my legs has gone down, and
my shoulders are moving much more easily now.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.000
- Ayaka...
- Hm?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.710
Um...

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.100
That's not right.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.000
Not right?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.700
Um... wasn't that a full-body massage?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.700
A... massage?!

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.760
No way.

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.999
Every part of my body feels so comfortable!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.320
Well, it is a massage, after all.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.499
The way the pressure
changes is really impressive.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.540
- Even my lower back feels lighter now.
- That's the magic of a good massage.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.270
My metabolism's improved too.
I feel like a whole new person!

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.000
That's the magic of a good massage.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.400
How could this happen?

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.000
That guy backed down. What a coward.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600
Alright.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
Alright, thank you.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.690
Sorry to trouble you.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.300
Sorry for being rude.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.600
Ayaka has probably already gone back...

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.600
Hiroko-san.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200
Let's go grab a drinkâ€¦

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.200
Hiroko-san, why?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.400
Why a massage?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.999
It's alright, there's really
no one right way to do things.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.059
Yeah.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.079
Risa was just a clueless
little puppy at first, too.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.069
Now she's a wolf who'll bare her fangs.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.400
Hey, Kyoko-san!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.500
No way?! Risa's the top?!

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.389
What a surprise.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.400
Do you hate it?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.200
Hiro-chan, you know...

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.600
She really cherishes Ayaka-chan, you know.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400
Cherish...?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200
Yeah.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.999
So...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.400
I think she probably doesn't
want to make a move so easily.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.400
The more I care about her... the more
I wish she'd reach out and touch me.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.100
Hiroko-san's feelings.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.100
I don't get it at all.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400
Ayaka-chan...

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300
Welcome!

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.900
Oh my!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.149
Hi.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.449
Jun?!

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.699
No way, you're back?!

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.600
Kyoko and Marina, long time no see.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.950
That's a new face.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.300
So cute!

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.230
Risa, sweetheart! Whatever
you do, don't look into Jun's eyes!

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.300
Ah! It's too late!

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.500
Risa, darling! Risa,
darling! Come back, quick!

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.109
Mama-san, I'm thirsty.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.400
What would you like to drink?

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.080
Anything's fine. As long as it's made
by you, Mama-san, it'll taste great.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.940
Seriously! You're just
as sweet-talking as ever.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.819
Hey, Jun! Tell us about things overseas!

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.859
Sure, what do you want to hear about?

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.500
Where's the most fun place?

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.460
Hmm... I'd say Los Angeles, probably.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.009
There's a cafÃ© called Planet.
It's a really interesting place.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:32.800
It attracts a lot of open-minded people.

00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:35.900
- Oh! I really want to check it out!
- Come back soon! Risa, darling!

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.500
Hey, who's Miss Jun?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.499
She's the rival for both me and Hiroko.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.300
Huh?! Hiroko-san's rival?!

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.820
She's the kind of woman who makes every
girl connected to her fall head over heels!

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.500
(10 years ago)

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.900
If you don't mind.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.100
Wanna grab a drink together?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.189
Hey, it's you again!

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.999
You're the one who
doesn't know when to stop!

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.069
I started the conversation
first! You back off!

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.299
You're the one who should back off!

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.899
Huh? Don't tell me you
like me or something?

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.959
Why are you here again today?!

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.850
Ugh! So annoying!

00:13:14.851 --> 00:13:15.976
Are you a stalker or something?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.099
- So scary, so scary.
- No way!

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.660
That's so disgusting.

00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:18.755
Ah! I'm calling the police!

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.776
Huh?! I should be the
one calling the cops first!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.900
Huh?! Didn't I tell you
to get out of the way?!

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Moscow Mule? Or Salty Dog?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.500
What?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.600
You're looking at the vodka, aren't you?

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.700
I can also make a "Sex on the Beach."

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.800
Let's go with that one.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.000
OK! It's on me.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.480
Jun's success rate at picking
people up is honestly off the charts.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.756
As much as I hate to admit it, both
Hiroko and I were completely defeated.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.089
Ayaka-chan and Risa should be careful too.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.440
They say that anyone who's ever looked
into those eyes can't escape their fate.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.870
So there really is something out
there that sounds just like a legend...

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.869
Actually, she just broke up
with her girlfriend recently...

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.900
Yeah...

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.500
Oh...

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.900
Is it really that impressive?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.780
Everyone ends up acting strange.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Uh...

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.500
Me... I'm not interested in
anyone except Hiroko-san.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.600
Hiroko is... who?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.300
Do you like Hiroko?

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.830
Yes.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.700
We're seriously dating.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.610
A serious relationship, huh.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.600
That's great.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.500
For Hiroko to be in such a serious relationship,
it looks like you've truly captivated her.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.700
I don't know.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.300
Why?

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400
Hiroko-san.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.000
She never touches me.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.800
Hiroko-san, who's known as the ace, must have had
relationships with a lot of girls in the past.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.500
But why is it only me?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.479
I want her to touch me more, too!

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.800
I just...

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.900
I just want us to be a real couple.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.800
If you're feeling unsatisfied,
how about I keep you company?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.800
I don't want to!

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.500
My heart belongs to
Hiroko and Hiroko alone!

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800
So cute.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.000
Just like a spoiled child.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
A spoiled kid?!

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.200
So innocent.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.000
I don't know anything.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.300
Isn't it just throwing a tantrum
because your opinion wasn't accepted?

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.300
Now that you mention it, I always...

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.700
I...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.500
I want to have a deeper
relationship with Hiroko-san.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.600
I hope we can always
be together from now on.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.000
I didn't consider how Hiroko-san feels.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.000
I have to make it work
today... My very first time.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.800
Please accept this!

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.000
Please don't run away.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.900
I want to be with Hiroko-san.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.200
To become a real couple!

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.400
For real?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.200
I've always just been forcing
my own feelings onto her...

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.300
Because I was too childish.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.620
So that's why she hasn't made a move on me?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.800
You said you want to
be a real couple, but...

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.800
What does it really
mean to be a true couple?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.840
Huhâ€¦?

00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:16.700
Can I go to Kyoko-san's place today?

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.710
Of course!

00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:19.800
Does sleeping together
make us a real couple?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800
Or is it...

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.900
If everyone around you acknowledges
it, does that make you a "real" couple?

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600
For example,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.500
Maybe it's easier to understand
if we're talking about marriage.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:39.000
But even though Japan now has a partnership
system, you still can't legally become spouses.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.300
So, what I'm saying isâ€¦

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.940
The finish line, there are as
many kinds as there are couples.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.600
That finish line.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.500
This isn't something you
can decide on your own.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800
The finish line...

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600
Not just one person...

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.400
If you want to stay together forever

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.700
I just have to become more mature.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.200
Do I have to endure it?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.600
That answer.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.200
It's up to you to decide.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.789
It feels pretty lively today...

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.790
Ah!

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.500
Here you go.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.089
Here comes the new drink!

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.200
Thank you.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.500
So cute!

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.200
Even though I get tipsy really easily...

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.820
How about we go check
it out together next time?

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.800
Getting jealous like
that is just so childish!

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.300
Why is it always with Junâ€¦

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.200
If I show possessiveness,
people will dislike me.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.700
At that moment...

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.700
My determination.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.200
Did it get through?

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.000
I've already put everything on the line.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.500
But...

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.500
If my selfish desires
spiral out of control...

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.300
If this would hurt Ayaka...

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.500
If we want to be together...

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.000
Then I'll just have to hold back...

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.200
The weather's really niceâ€¦

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Hm?

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.700
Huh?

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.900
Huh?!

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.000
Good morning.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Big sis.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.200
Last night was really amazing...

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Impressive?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400
Me too...

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.800
That was the first time
I've ever been that bold.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.800
Bold?

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.900
What do you mean by bold?

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600
Could it be...

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.600
I did that?!

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.119
(Next Episode Preview) Staying out all night
without even checking in. How irresponsible!

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.699
Why did you only come back in the morning?

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.660
Who were you with?

00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:38.749
Why didn't you contact me?

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.800
Hiroko-san, you naughty
perv! You big dummy!

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.600
I just want to be with
Ayaka all the time, that's all.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.899
I just want to be with
Hiroko-san all the time, that's all.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.829
I don't want my selfish desires
to make you feel disappointed.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.300
This can't go on like this!

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.399
Has Hiroko-san always been forcing herself?

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.100
I hope this happiness lasts a lifetime.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.866
<i>All child actors appeared with
guardian consent and were filmed safely.</i>

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.450
<i>Animal scenes were staged and
followed expert welfare guidelines.</i>

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.330
Did I drink too much?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.110
Is this a dream?

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.040
Or am I still in the novel?

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.346
Why is it so complicated?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.870
Gosh, whatever.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.996
Right?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.036
<i>Eun Ae comes out for a night walk</i>

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670
<i>and she meets Yi Beon.</i>

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.950
<i>I think that long-awaited
moment happens now.</i>

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.946
I can't miss a highlight like that.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.456
Where's Eun Ae?

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.500
Is she not here yet?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.546
<i>His features look like
delicately sculpted ice.</i>

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.156
<i>A perfect-looking man.</i>

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.210
<i>What? Why does this feel familiar?</i>

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.246
By chance, are you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.286
the male lead, Yi Beon, Prince Gyeongseong?

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.676
Gosh, it's you. It's you.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.116
I finally did it.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.040
Shake my hand.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.530
This is so crazy.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.906
Did you lose your mind?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.226
If you try to do anything funny,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.886
you might lose your fingers.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.846
Go ahead and try.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.606
The worst thing that
could happen is me dying

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.456
in this novel.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.840
You are staring at me directly

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.740
when you know who I am?

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.906
Because the rumor says something horrific

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.326
happens to you if you
make eye contact with you?

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.426
Why don't I check if that rumor

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.720
is true or not?

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.400
Try cutting these lips in half, too.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.856
You can't do it.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.726
To be honest, I know everything.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.356
The secrets you keep.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.286
Because you don't want to kill anyone,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.156
you created such rumors yourself.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.406
Even though you'd be left alone,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.856
you chose to be lonely

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.180
than to be in agony.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.736
It's not your fault.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.640
You did nothing wrong.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.410
Why

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.460
are you so sure that you know,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.226
- so well about me?
- It's because

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.496
I read your mind completely.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.436
You felt hurt because you were lonely.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.006
But once you fall in love,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.080
you're good to your woman.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.096
<i>No woman ever told me</i>

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.060
<i>something like that.</i>

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.336
[Episode 2: The first night in this life]

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.160
[Episode 2: The first
night in Yi Beon's life]

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.560
Gosh, my head.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.620
What are you doing?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.126
<i>My Lord.</i>

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.540
What do I do? What do I do?

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.756
Were you into this kind of thing?

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.260
<i>My Lord.</i>

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.166
No, no, no.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.116
This is not reality. This
is not the novel. No...

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.640
This is... What do you call it?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.446
Trying to evade what happened last night,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.390
if you're pretending not to remember...

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.526
Or if you're playing ignorant
because you think so lightly

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.436
of this between a man and a woman,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.576
so that you do not
think such a thing again,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.396
I will make sure to

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.280
crush this small head of yours.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.596
So, you had better

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.600
wait here until I come back.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.746
I had a one-night stand

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.210
with someone else's man?

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.030
Be calm. Let's think this through.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.806
Feeling upset from the Dahong Club meeting,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.296
<i>Eun Ae was walking alone and</i>

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.940
<i>ran into Yi Beon by the water.</i>

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.366
<i>By chance, because of me,</i>

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.196
did they miss their first encounter?

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.736
Gosh, that can't be...

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.506
But that could actually be the case...

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.876
This is unsettling.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.346
Why did I black out at that moment?

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.780
I need to check on my own.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.936
By chance,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.956
is my wish coming true, My Lord?

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.376
Or will she become a Buddhist nun, too?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.536
Was it your wish for me to marry?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.216
You know well.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.996
But you said you will never marry.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.746
So, I thought that was the case.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.076
The women who crossed paths with you once

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.376
are forced to become Buddhist nuns,
according to a rumor.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.446
Rumors can be useful sometimes.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.386
It was a rumor you started, of course.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.230
By the way, how...

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.606
<i>To be honest, I know everything.</i>

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.736
<i>The secrets you keep.</i>

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.996
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.960
<i>You did nothing wrong.</i>

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.486
Make sure she doesn't leave
Hoseondang until I return.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.700
Yes, sir.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.976
She is different than most noble women.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.880
So, take extra care.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.916
It might be good to
prepare a wedding proposal.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.620
Already?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.550
Did the sun rise from the west today?

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.020
Are you in there?

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.190
Are you in there?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.850
Is she still sleeping?

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.846
Why is it so complicated?

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.046
What is this, an escape room?

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.726
Gosh, is this right?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.390
You've got to be kidding.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.766
Hello.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.826
Hello.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.316
Which way should I go to exit?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.466
Well, t-that way.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.370
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.096
Who is she, by the way?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.576
I wonder.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.236
Looks like she came from the guest room.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.986
No way. At Hoseondang,

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.736
there is no woman except for the cook lady.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.306
Is she a thief, by chance?

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.506
We should catch her, then.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.486
Hold on. We cannot catch her.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.636
She could be a thief

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.700
who stole the Lord's heart.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.200
What happened yesterday, anyway?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.240
So, what happened to Eun Ae, then?

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.220
<i>This must be the place.</i>

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.000
Lady Sun Chaek.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.836
What happened yesterday?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.146
I was scared because
you suddenly disappeared.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.206
I must've drank too much last night.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.760
I don't remember so well.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.436
I prepared a tea that
is good for a hangover.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.506
Shall we?

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.970
Yes.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.296
Thank you so much for
helping me in a bind last night.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.950
I will forever be grateful.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.336
Well

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.716
I think I was

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.056
slightly drunk last night.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.326
Did I make a mistake in front of people

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.576
or cause trouble by chance?

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.656
Mistake? Oh, no.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.900
What are they called... your cocktails?

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.050
- Right?
- Yes...

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.376
Everyone was talking about them last night.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.136
The tea house was packed with people

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.320
who came to see your cocktails.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.456
Is that so?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.456
Yes. We will serve cocktails
for the full moon, too.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.636
Could you teach me your
know-how later, My Lady?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.586
H-How to make cocktails?

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.540
Well, if that's what you want.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.906
By chance,

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.346
d-did something else happen last night?

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.366
Something else?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.966
<i>Did Yi Beon and Eun
Ae even meet last night?</i>

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.446
Nothing else happened.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.996
Everyone went home happy, thanks to you.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.116
Everything went well.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.096
I see.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.136
<i>They couldn't meet because of me.</i>

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.706
Did you not run into someone named Yi Beon

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.380
or the Prince Gyeongseong
briefly, by chance?

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.546
I have heard of him many times,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.270
but I have never met him in person.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.226
I heard that Prince Gyeongseong
frequents this area these days.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.886
Aren't you curious?

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.940
- Really?
- Yes.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.776
That is a bit scary.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.286
I heard you cannot upset him or

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.366
make eye contact with him.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.956
I do not have a lot of connections,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.970
but the tea house people told me about him.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.226
But he might not be as scary as you think.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.706
Rumors are just rumors.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.136
Have you heard?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.350
According to what I heard recently

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.236
since he has no interest in women,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.116
there's a rumor that there might
be something wrong with him.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.136
Gosh, that's not true.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.100
To be exact, he's full of vitality.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.526
<i>I thought I didn't remember.</i>

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.336
<i>I remember now.</i>

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.150
<i>Crazy.</i>

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:44.056
I still have not broken away
from my brother's influence yet.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.636
Is it because I lack virtue?

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.666
It took long because it was
an undercover operation.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:54.260
You do not have to worry
about Heuksa Clan for a while.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.916
I need to get China's approval.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.506
I need to be appointed officially

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.540
so the former King's remaining factions
can't run wild any longer.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.486
Prince Gyeongseong, what do you think?

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.516
Our relationship with China is important,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.886
but securing people's support comes first.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.996
Since you've been focusing
on destroying the rebels,

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.826
you're not thinking clearly.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.716
Getting acknowledged by China

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.636
will naturally win the people's support.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.186
I have not

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.306
won your support yet, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.426
- That is not true-
- If not,

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.756
I would like you to lead the envoys

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.096
that I am sending to China.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.286
Take grains, visit the Emperor,

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.546
and bring me my official appointment.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.186
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.806
but I do not think I would be

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.686
able to join the envoys.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.936
Is there a particular reason?

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.736
There is something I need to take care of.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.396
I will not be able to for a while.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.886
Something to take care of?

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.456
I

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.710
Have someone I would
like to marry, Your Majesty.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.496
You hold no prejudices

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.636
and you speak up regardless of hierarchy.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.796
You even corrected the rumor
regarding Prince Gyeongseong.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.886
You are such a great person.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.710
<i>You are meant to end up with the male lead</i>

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:39.660
<i>and that would make this story
and my life easier, too.</i>

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.066
I think I developed a crush.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.546
- Pardon?
- On you, My Lady.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.456
Can I dare ask you to be my friend?

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.190
I would like to see you often.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.650
U-Us being friends is...

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.646
It might be kind of difficult.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.976
Of course, you dislike me, too.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.806
I am sorry. I should have known better.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.446
I dare asked to befriend
the minister's daughter.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.836
No, it's not like that.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.726
I am an orphan with an unknown origin

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.546
and they say I seduced my father
and got adopted as a mistress...

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.766
Who says that?

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:24.406
I'm very aware of how
great of a person you are.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.256
Even when you struggle or are sad,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.486
you help others who struggle more than you.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.406
You're such a blessing.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.220
How dare they say bullshit like that...

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.856
Let's be friends, okay?

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.260
You aren't allowed to say
something so pitiful, okay?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.100
Lady Sun Chaek.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.706
How about you join the
envoys in three months?

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.120
Get married during that time.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.636
Your wedding will be

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.436
treated with utmost
respect in the royal court.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.076
You will not refuse this, will you?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.186
All right, then.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.330
I will follow your order.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.596
You should also experience
the family affection

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.490
you didn't know about for a while.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.886
I will take my leave.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.530
All right.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.626
He suddenly wants to get married.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.436
What is he thinking?

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.356
Watch him closely from now on.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.730
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.146
Is that not the Prince Gyeongseong?

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.490
Looks like he just visited His Majesty.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.310
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.416
Queen Mother.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.226
What happened to you?

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.646
Your handsome face looks so tired.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.326
Did you have a serious
conversation at the Main Hall?

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.300
It is nothing.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:39.826
If so, I think you need
a wife to care for you.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:44.486
That would liven up your face a little.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.456
I am planning to invite all the daughters

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.176
of noble families at the
banquet early this month.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.716
How about you find a wife there?

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.326
I appreciate your concern,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.186
but I will choose who I will marry.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.100
I will take my leave now.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.820
Fine.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.166
He insidiously hides his feelings.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.806
It is impossible to
know what he is thinking.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.676
Is it still about what happened then?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.740
How could he be so sharp as a razor?

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.200
The thing is...

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.106
Is that true?

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.860
He took in a woman last night?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.416
Not only did I have a one-night
stand with the male lead,

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.530
I befriended the female lead, too.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.716
This isn't right.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.066
Yes. This happened because of me.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.116
I need to correct things somehow.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.606
Gosh, what do I do?

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.786
My Lady!

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.100
Lady Sun Chaek!

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.430
My Lady... My Lady...

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.166
My Lady, where did you
spend the night last night?

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.306
Something serious happened.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.286
Things can't get any worse than it is.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.426
You should have warned me sooner.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.086
I had no idea you had a lover.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.296
What do you mean a lover?

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.606
Gosh, you are so clueless.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.426
You are about to get married.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.396
Get married?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.880
<i>A wedding proposal for you just arrived.</i>

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.136
So, did my family see it?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.296
They are not home right now.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.676
I wanted to warn you
before His Excellency gets home.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.840
But he should be coming home soon.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.186
<i>I'm getting married at this point?</i>

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.670
<i>No, I need to stop it.</i>

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.250
My Lady, move!

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.316
<i>Maybe this is how...</i>

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>Cha Sun Chaek leaves the story.</i>

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.986
Gosh, she survived.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.760
She survived. She survived.

00:23:45.964 --> 00:23:49.190
I told you to stay put and wait.

00:23:49.214 --> 00:23:51.330
Did you want to get killed by a horse
before the wedding?

00:23:51.354 --> 00:23:55.050
I never asked you to send a wedding
proposal or whatever.

00:23:55.074 --> 00:23:59.230
Wedding proposals have nothing
to do with how the couple feels.

00:23:59.254 --> 00:24:01.140
It's just formality between the families.

00:24:01.164 --> 00:24:03.950
Do you think it makes sense

00:24:03.974 --> 00:24:05.790
for us to get married?

00:24:05.814 --> 00:24:07.650
If a man and woman spent a night together,

00:24:07.674 --> 00:24:10.120
they have to get married, of course.

00:24:10.144 --> 00:24:13.160
But I have no memory of it.

00:24:13.184 --> 00:24:15.380
If you say you have no memory of it,

00:24:15.404 --> 00:24:17.730
will it cancel out what happened?

00:24:17.754 --> 00:24:20.100
And I remember last night very clearly.

00:24:20.124 --> 00:24:22.650
Who took my clothes off so aggressively?

00:24:22.674 --> 00:24:25.400
Someone might hear you. Lower your voice.

00:24:25.424 --> 00:24:28.570
You have shame. You had none yesterday.

00:24:28.594 --> 00:24:30.700
Even if I did,

00:24:30.724 --> 00:24:34.080
I don't think we should
get married only because of that.

00:24:34.104 --> 00:24:36.740
You seduced me and spent a night with me.

00:24:36.764 --> 00:24:39.070
But you are denying it now?

00:24:39.094 --> 00:24:43.850
Are you blaming me for
everything, by chance?

00:24:43.874 --> 00:24:47.670
It wasn't your first time, was it?

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:50.544
Come on. It wasn't right?

00:24:55.074 --> 00:24:58.300
Do you think I am a horny
animal who sleeps with

00:24:58.324 --> 00:25:00.090
any woman I can find?

00:25:00.114 --> 00:25:03.310
No, it's not that...

00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:07.060
<i>With your face, body, and wealth,</i>

00:25:07.084 --> 00:25:09.910
<i>you had to have been with a woman before.</i>

00:25:09.934 --> 00:25:12.620
The first night with a woman
is important to a nobleman.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.490
That is why I have been saving myself.

00:25:14.514 --> 00:25:16.130
Since we spent the first night together,

00:25:16.154 --> 00:25:19.820
of course, we should be
responsible for the other.

00:25:19.844 --> 00:25:23.924
<i>Why is he so obsessed with the first night?</i>

00:25:25.384 --> 00:25:29.190
But still, I think this is too unfair.

00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:32.084
I cannot marry you.

00:25:35.504 --> 00:25:37.364
If so,

00:25:39.974 --> 00:25:43.470
you seduced me on purpose
and took my virginity away.

00:25:43.494 --> 00:25:45.600
Not only that, you stopped me trying to go

00:25:45.624 --> 00:25:48.700
against the King's word
and tried to hurt me.

00:25:48.724 --> 00:25:50.250
That is an attempt at
assuming royal authority.

00:25:50.274 --> 00:25:54.194
It is safe to call it treason.

00:25:55.114 --> 00:25:58.130
Yes, that is exactly it.

00:25:58.154 --> 00:25:59.774
This is

00:26:01.274 --> 00:26:03.540
treason.

00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:04.920
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

00:26:04.944 --> 00:26:06.120
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:08.260
<i>Wait for me! Wait.</i>

00:26:08.284 --> 00:26:10.040
<i>Hurry up.</i>

00:26:10.064 --> 00:26:12.520
How do you like the yeot, Father?

00:26:12.544 --> 00:26:15.484
It is very sweet.

00:26:22.004 --> 00:26:23.350
<i>Not only you,</i>

00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:26.450
<i>but the family can lose their rank
and positions immediately.</i>

00:26:26.474 --> 00:26:29.840
<i>Three generations can be executed,
so the family ceases to exist.</i>

00:26:29.864 --> 00:26:33.580
<i>Who would be responsible
for the end of the Cha family?</i>

00:26:33.604 --> 00:26:35.400
Sun Chaek,

00:26:35.424 --> 00:26:38.250
why couldn't you just marry him?

00:26:38.274 --> 00:26:40.454
Why did you do that?

00:26:41.394 --> 00:26:44.820
How dare you turn down
the Prince Gyeongseong?

00:26:44.844 --> 00:26:46.840
I never even got to marry.

00:26:46.864 --> 00:26:49.140
You think I did?

00:26:49.164 --> 00:26:52.940
This is where our family's bloodline ends.

00:26:52.964 --> 00:26:54.470
My dear ancestors,

00:26:54.494 --> 00:26:57.250
I am terribly sorry.

00:26:57.274 --> 00:26:59.760
I hope we do not

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:03.240
meet again in the next life.

00:27:03.264 --> 00:27:05.840
<i>What if this family actually ceases</i>

00:27:05.864 --> 00:27:08.774
<i>to exist because of me?</i>

00:27:12.704 --> 00:27:15.230
I'm sorry!

00:27:15.254 --> 00:27:17.080
I'll get married.

00:27:17.104 --> 00:27:21.270
So, please spare me.

00:27:21.294 --> 00:27:22.670
What can I say?

00:27:22.694 --> 00:27:25.434
You only had one chance.

00:27:30.554 --> 00:27:32.580
This woman deceived me.

00:27:32.604 --> 00:27:35.670
Kill her very cruelly and painfully.

00:27:35.694 --> 00:27:37.560
Yes, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:27:37.584 --> 00:27:39.340
She tarnished a royal's virginity.

00:27:39.364 --> 00:27:41.640
Cha Sun Chaek, a traitor

00:27:41.664 --> 00:27:44.534
will be torn apart to death!

00:27:47.364 --> 00:27:49.564
Spare me!

00:28:18.804 --> 00:28:20.420
<i>He was acting crazy earlier.</i>

00:28:20.444 --> 00:28:23.104
<i>Why does he have such a sweet smile?</i>

00:28:24.104 --> 00:28:26.914
You must care about your family.

00:28:29.684 --> 00:28:32.810
I care about all lives.

00:28:32.834 --> 00:28:35.930
That's why I'd like to share the news about

00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:39.830
my marriage personally with my dear family.

00:28:39.854 --> 00:28:41.834
I'm their precious only daughter.

00:28:41.874 --> 00:28:45.330
If I suddenly tell them I'll get married,
they'll feel disappointed.

00:28:45.354 --> 00:28:48.420
Until I bring it up with them myself,

00:28:48.444 --> 00:28:51.520
could you wait just a moment?

00:28:51.544 --> 00:28:53.800
Sure, fine.

00:28:53.824 --> 00:28:56.720
I will give you three days.

00:28:56.744 --> 00:28:58.170
After three days,

00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:01.180
I will resend the wedding proposal.

00:29:01.204 --> 00:29:05.390
<i>How about you join the
envoys in three months?</i>

00:29:05.414 --> 00:29:07.894
<i>Get married during that time.</i>

00:29:07.974 --> 00:29:09.360
<i>Your wedding will be</i>

00:29:09.384 --> 00:29:12.874
<i>treated with utmost
respect in the royal court.</i>

00:29:12.914 --> 00:29:15.574
<i>You will not refuse this, will you?</i>

00:29:16.784 --> 00:29:20.460
Three days is... That's way too short.

00:29:20.484 --> 00:29:23.380
No, it is more than enough.

00:29:23.404 --> 00:29:25.950
As long as you do not try to run away.

00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:29.874
If you are thinking that,
you had better give up now.

00:29:31.254 --> 00:29:32.844
Of course not.

00:29:32.874 --> 00:29:37.790
The geography and security
of this city is in the palm of my hands.

00:29:37.814 --> 00:29:40.000
If you want to confirm that,

00:29:40.024 --> 00:29:42.164
feel free to try.

00:29:47.454 --> 00:29:49.944
So, you did not come home last night

00:29:49.974 --> 00:29:52.750
because you slept with the Prince...
the Prince Gyeongseong?

00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:55.350
We didn't just sleep together.
It was his first time, apparently.

00:29:55.374 --> 00:29:57.940
And he said to be
responsible by marrying him.

00:29:57.964 --> 00:29:59.730
How does that make sense?

00:29:59.754 --> 00:30:02.520
So, what will he do about
the wedding proposal?

00:30:02.544 --> 00:30:04.490
He said he will resend it in three days.

00:30:04.514 --> 00:30:08.030
So, I'll run far away
as quickly as possible.

00:30:08.054 --> 00:30:10.820
Pack everything that's small,
light, and worth money.

00:30:10.844 --> 00:30:12.614
Oh, yes...

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:18.960
Why do you have to run away, by the way?

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:22.644
The Prince may not be the nicest person,

00:30:22.674 --> 00:30:26.520
but he is a royal, handsome,
and all women desire him.

00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:28.980
That makes him the best marriage material.

00:30:29.004 --> 00:30:30.560
That is not all.

00:30:30.584 --> 00:30:33.360
You will become the King's
relative by marrying him.

00:30:33.384 --> 00:30:35.620
You will get paid regularly for that.

00:30:35.644 --> 00:30:38.450
It would be an honor
to the family, too. Isn't that nice?

00:30:38.474 --> 00:30:41.450
That has always been your dream.

00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:43.160
- My dream?
- Yes.

00:30:43.184 --> 00:30:45.910
Your dream has always been

00:30:45.934 --> 00:30:48.850
marrying a son of a
family that is suitable,

00:30:48.874 --> 00:30:52.374
<i>having as many children
as possible, living a happy life,</i>

00:30:52.424 --> 00:30:54.260
<i>and ending your life in peace</i>

00:30:54.284 --> 00:30:57.900
<i>while being cared for
by your grandchildren.</i>

00:30:57.924 --> 00:31:01.300
I'd enjoy a lot of things as a royal,

00:31:01.324 --> 00:31:04.534
but that would put me in danger, too.

00:31:07.894 --> 00:31:09.944
No!

00:31:09.974 --> 00:31:13.310
Spare us.

00:31:13.334 --> 00:31:15.100
The female lead always

00:31:15.124 --> 00:31:18.500
face all sorts of hardship and danger.

00:31:18.524 --> 00:31:21.310
Gosh, I don't want to be the female lead.

00:31:21.334 --> 00:31:22.820
And most importantly...

00:31:22.844 --> 00:31:26.684
<i>The Prince is supposed
to marry someone else.</i>

00:31:27.664 --> 00:31:30.550
But you said he wants to marry you.

00:31:30.574 --> 00:31:33.290
That's why I need to run away quickly.

00:31:33.314 --> 00:31:35.560
That will not be easy.

00:31:35.584 --> 00:31:39.300
If he sets his mind to it,
there is no one he cannot find

00:31:39.324 --> 00:31:42.664
or get rid of in this world.

00:31:45.064 --> 00:31:46.230
See?

00:31:46.254 --> 00:31:48.120
He must've noticed you were running away.

00:31:48.144 --> 00:31:50.114
What do I do?

00:31:58.694 --> 00:32:02.440
Do you not even invite
your guests to come in?

00:32:02.464 --> 00:32:05.784
You cannot just barge in like this.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:11.280
Are you okay, Bang Wool?

00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:13.370
How dare you touch me?

00:32:13.394 --> 00:32:15.624
Go outside and stay away.

00:32:20.884 --> 00:32:23.684
What brings you here?

00:32:25.964 --> 00:32:29.164
I stopped by to ask you something.

00:32:31.214 --> 00:32:32.640
Last night,

00:32:32.664 --> 00:32:36.000
you suddenly left the club meeting.

00:32:36.024 --> 00:32:38.220
You went to Prince Gyeongseong's Hoseondang

00:32:38.244 --> 00:32:39.910
and left this morning.

00:32:39.934 --> 00:32:43.164
Someone I know saw it. Is that true?

00:32:44.464 --> 00:32:46.280
That's...

00:32:46.304 --> 00:32:47.310
T-The thing is.

00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:49.060
It is true.

00:32:49.084 --> 00:32:52.364
Well, I don't really remember it...

00:32:54.074 --> 00:32:55.440
Don't try to lie, and

00:32:55.464 --> 00:32:58.444
say you do not remember
because you were drunk.

00:32:59.674 --> 00:33:04.064
By chance, did you spend
the night with the Prince?

00:33:08.194 --> 00:33:10.314
My hunch was correct.

00:33:11.304 --> 00:33:12.850
You let me have the silk
dress and sided with me

00:33:12.874 --> 00:33:15.250
but you stabbed me in
the back? How shameless.

00:33:15.274 --> 00:33:16.810
<i>Is this when...</i>

00:33:16.834 --> 00:33:20.354
<i>Do Hwa Seon uses her signature
move by splashing water?</i>

00:33:33.724 --> 00:33:35.620
What are you doing...

00:33:35.644 --> 00:33:38.340
Were you prepared to disgrace me?

00:33:38.364 --> 00:33:41.270
No, I didn't do that.

00:33:41.294 --> 00:33:44.130
You splashed water at me first.

00:33:44.154 --> 00:33:47.434
All I did was block it like this.

00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:52.754
The fan the Queen
Mother gave me was ruined.

00:33:59.534 --> 00:34:01.780
I will repay you for this humiliation.

00:34:01.804 --> 00:34:06.060
I will do so much more than
just splashing water next time.

00:34:06.084 --> 00:34:08.064
Just wait and see.

00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:17.190
What's going on?

00:34:17.214 --> 00:34:20.250
Why do things keep going haywire?

00:34:20.274 --> 00:34:22.410
I'm not supposed to do anything.

00:34:22.434 --> 00:34:26.714
Why does my body keep
moving against my will?

00:34:30.314 --> 00:34:32.630
My Lady,

00:34:32.654 --> 00:34:37.174
you do not have to do
this for someone like me.

00:34:40.004 --> 00:34:42.390
You are the only one

00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:44.864
who took revenge for me.

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:49.750
I will do anything for you from now on.

00:34:49.774 --> 00:34:51.210
My Lady.

00:34:51.234 --> 00:34:53.344
My Lady! My Lady!

00:35:03.854 --> 00:35:07.174
Beon, what brings you here?

00:35:07.744 --> 00:35:10.250
I am here because you said this place

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.810
has the best view of Hanyang.

00:35:12.834 --> 00:35:15.740
You never seemed to listen to me.

00:35:15.764 --> 00:35:18.690
I have never seen you doing this.

00:35:18.714 --> 00:35:20.410
So.

00:35:20.434 --> 00:35:22.924
Have you really not been
to this gazebo before?

00:35:24.184 --> 00:35:26.510
Everyone knows about this one.

00:35:26.534 --> 00:35:28.594
This is my first time here.

00:35:30.784 --> 00:35:33.630
What has gotten into our Beon?

00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:38.534
What made you visit a
place for the first time?

00:35:40.644 --> 00:35:43.620
You said your binoculars were broken.

00:35:43.644 --> 00:35:45.184
Yes.

00:35:46.404 --> 00:35:48.000
It broke

00:35:48.024 --> 00:35:50.180
because I dropped it from a rooftop.

00:35:50.204 --> 00:35:52.304
It was not easy to acquire these.

00:35:54.304 --> 00:35:56.010
Let me get you a new pair.

00:35:56.034 --> 00:35:57.474
Do you mean it?

00:35:58.194 --> 00:35:59.514
But why?

00:36:00.184 --> 00:36:02.300
I would love that,

00:36:02.324 --> 00:36:04.890
but you are acting very suspiciously.

00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:09.234
Let us say it is to
celebrate my first visit here.

00:36:09.964 --> 00:36:11.750
And most importantly,

00:36:11.774 --> 00:36:16.364
it is because you are
my first and only friend.

00:36:18.284 --> 00:36:23.230
It looks like you find all
things first meaningful.

00:36:23.254 --> 00:36:25.570
I am still your only friend because

00:36:25.594 --> 00:36:28.324
you did not let anyone in afterward.

00:36:30.784 --> 00:36:33.410
I thought everyone was like that.

00:36:33.434 --> 00:36:35.140
It is

00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:38.160
special because not everyone

00:36:38.184 --> 00:36:40.454
cherishes the beginning.

00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:44.220
I hope you have many beginnings.

00:36:44.244 --> 00:36:46.400
That way, I would

00:36:46.424 --> 00:36:49.004
strike more gold like this.

00:37:03.604 --> 00:37:05.104
My Lady...

00:37:14.924 --> 00:37:16.390
<i>Plan A.</i>

00:37:16.414 --> 00:37:18.144
<i>Escape.</i>

00:37:20.014 --> 00:37:21.480
We were told not to let any unwed

00:37:21.504 --> 00:37:23.530
noblewomen through the four gates.

00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:25.610
This is something very urgent.

00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:29.024
I cannot disobey the
order from above, either.

00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:33.730
My Lady is so ill.

00:37:33.754 --> 00:37:37.434
She needs to rehabilitate
in the countryside.

00:37:42.374 --> 00:37:43.690
If that is why,

00:37:43.714 --> 00:37:46.260
there is a good place
to rehabilitate in Hanyang, too.

00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:48.370
It is called Hoseondang Spa.

00:37:48.394 --> 00:37:49.400
Hoseondang?

00:37:49.424 --> 00:37:51.870
It is a spa owned by
the Prince Gyeongseong.

00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:53.974
How about you go there instead?

00:37:57.584 --> 00:37:59.554
My Lady! Gosh...

00:38:14.154 --> 00:38:16.200
Let me do a search.

00:38:16.224 --> 00:38:18.610
As you can tell,

00:38:18.634 --> 00:38:20.550
I am not a noblewoman.

00:38:20.574 --> 00:38:24.950
It is a search for finding a culprit.

00:38:24.974 --> 00:38:26.280
Culprit?

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.870
As soon as we find the woman
who stole one and only thing

00:38:28.894 --> 00:38:31.684
very precious to the Prince Gyeongseong,

00:38:33.314 --> 00:38:36.994
we are supposed to arrest and detain her.

00:38:45.074 --> 00:38:48.280
You had better just leave quietly.

00:38:48.304 --> 00:38:51.250
If you walk past this gate,

00:38:51.274 --> 00:38:54.544
he will send bounty hunters.

00:38:55.614 --> 00:38:57.624
No way...

00:38:58.904 --> 00:39:00.594
No!

00:39:01.344 --> 00:39:03.030
Let me go!

00:39:03.054 --> 00:39:06.654
We will bring her body if we have to!

00:39:15.674 --> 00:39:17.614
No! No!

00:39:20.724 --> 00:39:21.974
Lift her.

00:39:22.924 --> 00:39:25.384
- Okay, let us go.
- Save me...

00:39:38.744 --> 00:39:41.394
You appear to be in a good mood.

00:39:47.694 --> 00:39:49.220
That cannot be.

00:39:49.244 --> 00:39:51.094
You are mistaken.

00:39:52.034 --> 00:39:55.904
Can I dare to tell you something?

00:39:58.684 --> 00:40:02.390
Fear tactics do not work in this field.

00:40:02.414 --> 00:40:06.754
The engagement policy
works well in this case.

00:40:16.154 --> 00:40:20.820
I can't seem to breathe.

00:40:20.844 --> 00:40:22.870
If you really do not want to,

00:40:22.894 --> 00:40:27.764
just make the Prince
fall out of love with you.

00:40:28.744 --> 00:40:32.030
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:34.670
Gosh, Bang Wool.

00:40:34.694 --> 00:40:38.160
You're smarter than I thought, Bang Wool.

00:40:38.184 --> 00:40:42.944
What would be a good way,
do you think, for example?

00:40:44.514 --> 00:40:46.260
I am not sure.

00:40:46.284 --> 00:40:48.910
I have thought about how
to make someone like me,

00:40:48.934 --> 00:40:52.660
but I have never tried to do the opposite.

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:54.880
The kind of woman men hate...

00:40:54.904 --> 00:40:58.624
The kind of woman men hate?

00:41:02.214 --> 00:41:03.964
Yes.

00:41:04.964 --> 00:41:08.454
Perhaps I'm an expert in this field.

00:41:09.933 --> 00:41:11.006
<i>My Lord!</i>

00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:12.797
<i>My Lord! My Lord!</i>

00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:14.967
My Lord. My Lord.

00:41:14.991 --> 00:41:17.217
Send the wedding proposal in two days.

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.737
Is the rest of the preparation going well?

00:41:19.761 --> 00:41:21.647
This is more urgent.

00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:24.051
You need to see this.

00:41:37.141 --> 00:41:40.641
What am I seeing right now?

00:41:41.381 --> 00:41:44.001
I am not so sure, either.

00:41:45.371 --> 00:41:47.857
Gosh, My Lord.

00:41:47.881 --> 00:41:51.401
You must have missed me this morning.

00:41:59.311 --> 00:42:01.357
What are you doing here?

00:42:01.381 --> 00:42:02.807
<i>Plan B.</i>

00:42:02.831 --> 00:42:06.177
<i>Provoke the obsessive male lead.</i>

00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:08.137
<i>As I know, Yi Beon from the novel</i>

00:42:08.161 --> 00:42:11.657
<i>hates anything dirty and impure.</i>

00:42:11.681 --> 00:42:13.907
<i>He won't be able to stand this.</i>

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.041
Why do you look like this?

00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:19.597
You smell, too.

00:42:19.621 --> 00:42:21.187
Gosh, the fertilizer smell.

00:42:21.211 --> 00:42:25.357
I dug up and ate some because I got hungry.

00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:27.937
Unlike how I look,

00:42:27.961 --> 00:42:30.277
I love emergency crops like this.

00:42:30.301 --> 00:42:33.027
And you aren't smelling fertilizer.

00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:34.777
It's actual poop.

00:42:34.801 --> 00:42:36.957
My stomach hurts because I ate too much.

00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:40.497
So, I pooped and buried it there.

00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:41.807
For cleaning,

00:42:41.831 --> 00:42:44.641
this foxtail grass is perfect.

00:42:45.871 --> 00:42:47.547
As time goes by,

00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:51.761
it will fertilize Hoseondang's soil, too.

00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:55.557
<i>Disgusting and insufferable, right?</i>

00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:58.217
<i>With your clean and
perfectionist personality.</i>

00:42:58.241 --> 00:42:59.547
<i>Ditch me already.</i>

00:42:59.571 --> 00:43:01.901
<i>I'm ready for it.</i>

00:43:15.661 --> 00:43:18.397
A nobleman's daughter's hands

00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:21.147
show signs of labor.

00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:23.537
It's very refreshing and inspiring.

00:43:23.561 --> 00:43:25.617
- Pardon?
- Not only do you have a common appetite,

00:43:25.641 --> 00:43:27.657
you are harvesting emergency crops during

00:43:27.681 --> 00:43:30.737
downtime to encourage and inspire others.

00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:32.597
You will set an example

00:43:32.621 --> 00:43:34.361
as a royal.

00:43:44.031 --> 00:43:45.657
Let us go.

00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.367
Well, yes.

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.061
Yes...

00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:52.637
<i>Plan C.</i>

00:43:52.661 --> 00:43:54.237
<i>A toxic woman's</i>

00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:56.297
<i>vanity and extravagance.</i>

00:43:56.321 --> 00:43:58.637
Gosh, My Lady.

00:43:58.661 --> 00:44:01.577
If you buy this much,
even the Minister's family

00:44:01.601 --> 00:44:04.227
would run out of money soon.

00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:05.397
Shut up.

00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:06.587
I want to buy things.

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:08.647
How dare a servant lecture me?

00:44:08.671 --> 00:44:11.481
Should I cut off your wrists immediately?

00:44:12.161 --> 00:44:14.777
Gosh, for my delicate wrists

00:44:14.801 --> 00:44:17.357
even this jewelry is so heavy.

00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:19.511
You carry this, too.

00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:26.307
Did I toss it that hard?

00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:28.727
My Lady.

00:44:28.751 --> 00:44:32.371
Gosh, the Prince Gyeongseong.

00:44:34.041 --> 00:44:35.767
We run into each other often.

00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:36.887
What are you doing here?

00:44:36.911 --> 00:44:39.807
Our upcoming wedding
has made me feel restless.

00:44:39.831 --> 00:44:42.647
I wanted to adorn myself from head to toe.

00:44:42.671 --> 00:44:45.367
I bought the best goods in Joseon...

00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:47.957
No, I only bought imported goods.

00:44:47.981 --> 00:44:49.147
Why?

00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.947
Because I worship foreign countries.

00:44:52.971 --> 00:44:55.037
I want to continue to buy all the

00:44:55.061 --> 00:44:59.257
limited edition goods from
Japan and China from now on.

00:44:59.281 --> 00:45:01.807
Can you buy them for
me the rest of my life,

00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:03.607
Prince Gyeongseong?

00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:06.751
<i>A clueless beauty who
spends taxpayers' money.</i>

00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:10.891
<i>A royal like Yi Beon
won't tolerate this, right?</i>

00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:16.031
Aigoo, so heavy...

00:45:20.391 --> 00:45:23.367
You need to dress like
this to be on my level.

00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:26.577
Envoys are visiting us in a few months.

00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:28.701
Please assist me with that.

00:45:33.101 --> 00:45:36.651
You have a global taste, too.

00:45:38.291 --> 00:45:40.527
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.697
<i>It's not working at all.</i>

00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:46.461
<i>Why is he so impenetrable?</i>

00:45:49.221 --> 00:45:51.107
<i>Plan D.</i>

00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:53.311
<i>Fatalism.</i>

00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:10.427
What brings you here at this late hour?

00:46:10.451 --> 00:46:13.931
You could not have missed me already.

00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:19.417
We're not supposed to miss each other.

00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:20.477
What do you mean by that?

00:46:20.501 --> 00:46:22.317
Using your fortune,

00:46:22.341 --> 00:46:25.541
and mine, I checked our compatibility.

00:46:29.261 --> 00:46:31.401
How is our compatibility?

00:46:33.631 --> 00:46:35.237
It says if we get married,

00:46:35.261 --> 00:46:39.561
you're destined to die young, apparently.

00:46:43.931 --> 00:46:45.377
It does not matter.

00:46:45.401 --> 00:46:46.517
Pardon?

00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:49.817
I-It doesn't matter?

00:46:49.841 --> 00:46:53.147
They say you will die if you marry me.

00:46:53.171 --> 00:46:55.717
I think of this life

00:46:55.741 --> 00:46:58.637
as a bonus, anyway.

00:46:58.661 --> 00:47:00.807
If I could meet someone I love

00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:02.991
and live happily, even briefly,

00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:06.657
I will think of it as a gift from my parents

00:47:06.681 --> 00:47:08.147
and accept it willingly.

00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:12.847
No, I'll become a widow.

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:16.177
All of my assets will become yours, then.

00:47:16.201 --> 00:47:17.621
However,

00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:21.647
you cannot remarry.

00:47:21.671 --> 00:47:25.311
I will not allow you another
man even if I am dead.

00:47:39.571 --> 00:47:41.057
<i>Plan E.</i>

00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:42.797
<i>Become religious.</i>

00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:46.717
A noble lady is joining the temple?

00:47:46.741 --> 00:47:48.887
Yes, that is correct.

00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:51.027
Being free from material
desires and pain...

00:47:51.051 --> 00:47:52.357
<i>Especially Yi Beon.</i>

00:47:52.381 --> 00:47:54.127
Is my wish.

00:47:54.151 --> 00:47:55.887
Please accept me

00:47:55.911 --> 00:47:59.361
I am sorry, but you cannot join the temple.

00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:02.391
How did you know I was here?

00:48:07.381 --> 00:48:10.077
Do you know each other?

00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:13.937
Of course. We know each other very well.

00:48:13.961 --> 00:48:17.257
Why do you say she cannot join us?

00:48:17.281 --> 00:48:19.107
You only need faith in Buddha's world.

00:48:19.131 --> 00:48:22.897
This maiden lacks in faith.

00:48:22.921 --> 00:48:24.537
First of all,

00:48:24.561 --> 00:48:26.947
she loves drinking. Very much so.

00:48:26.971 --> 00:48:28.777
I can quit.

00:48:28.801 --> 00:48:30.607
Of course, I should.

00:48:30.631 --> 00:48:32.507
And she loves eating meat.

00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:34.507
For breakfasts, her family

00:48:34.531 --> 00:48:36.907
eats meat from land, sea, and sky.

00:48:36.931 --> 00:48:39.897
I ate it because they were there.

00:48:39.921 --> 00:48:41.347
They were there.

00:48:41.371 --> 00:48:43.817
I can go vegetarian, ma'am.

00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:46.487
And I won't eat much, either.

00:48:46.511 --> 00:48:49.467
So, please accept me.

00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:51.681
Please spare me.

00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:54.737
It is up to her to join the temple.

00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:57.317
No one can stop someone from doing that.

00:48:57.341 --> 00:49:00.467
Ma'am, I just thought about something

00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:02.321
I forgot to mention.

00:49:03.051 --> 00:49:06.437
It is a reason she cannot become a monk.

00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:08.121
What is it...

00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:17.967
Can a woman who is not
celibate become a monk?

00:49:17.991 --> 00:49:19.327
P-Pardon?

00:49:19.351 --> 00:49:21.067
It's not true, ma'am!

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:22.647
You lie now?

00:49:22.671 --> 00:49:25.807
Lying is not permitted in Buddha's world.

00:49:25.831 --> 00:49:27.657
Don't listen to this man, ma'am.

00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:30.577
- I-
- Gosh, stop!

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:33.097
I am the one she spent the night.

00:49:33.121 --> 00:49:35.207
Namu Amitabha,
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...

00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:38.637
- Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva...
- He's out of his mind, ma'am.

00:49:38.661 --> 00:49:39.977
I swear it's not true.

00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:42.371
You will not become a monk.

00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:45.417
<i>Forget about the plans.</i>

00:49:45.441 --> 00:49:47.497
<i>Is running away at night the only option?</i>

00:49:47.521 --> 00:49:49.097
<i>Just run away.</i>

00:49:49.121 --> 00:49:50.747
Nothing works.

00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:53.291
How could this be?

00:49:54.621 --> 00:49:57.261
I just need to disappear.

00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:04.247
Wow, we smelled makeup powder
in the middle of the night.

00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:05.487
We had to come check.

00:50:05.511 --> 00:50:08.031
It is not just the makeup powder.

00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:11.181
I smell gold, too.

00:50:11.911 --> 00:50:13.377
I'll give you this.

00:50:13.401 --> 00:50:15.537
I swear I didn't see anything.

00:50:15.561 --> 00:50:16.997
It's so dark.

00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:20.307
It looks like you are a
nobleman's daughter.

00:50:20.331 --> 00:50:23.157
Should we sell the jewelry and silk?

00:50:23.181 --> 00:50:26.007
I knew I had a lucky dream.

00:50:26.031 --> 00:50:28.767
We will finally make good money.

00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:31.281
Help me!

00:50:32.831 --> 00:50:35.697
Screaming will not help.

00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:38.681
There are not even ants here at night.

00:50:39.311 --> 00:50:42.181
So, go ahead.

00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:46.877
What?

00:50:46.901 --> 00:50:48.261
Geez.

00:50:48.961 --> 00:50:50.441
This is

00:50:52.021 --> 00:50:53.177
yeot.

00:50:53.201 --> 00:50:56.441
Yeot fell from the sky?

00:51:20.281 --> 00:51:22.577
Gosh, my apologies.

00:51:22.601 --> 00:51:26.417
I was eating yeot while stargazing.

00:51:26.441 --> 00:51:29.027
But I dropped it by accident.

00:51:29.051 --> 00:51:31.571
<i>Supporting character, Jung Su Gyeom?</i>

00:51:32.261 --> 00:51:33.637
Are you okay?

00:51:33.661 --> 00:51:35.247
- Help me.
- Geez.

00:51:35.271 --> 00:51:38.477
- You look like a pretty boy.
- Come on.

00:51:38.501 --> 00:51:40.517
Do not do anything dangerous now.

00:51:40.541 --> 00:51:42.267
Since we are in this situation,

00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:44.287
we will have to kill you both.

00:51:44.311 --> 00:51:45.937
I will take the lady.

00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:48.117
No, I will take the lady.

00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:51.161
Do you have a sword? Can you fight?

00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:54.627
We're dead.

00:51:54.651 --> 00:51:55.747
Are you a good runner?

00:51:55.771 --> 00:51:57.287
Pardon?

00:51:57.311 --> 00:51:59.481
It is okay if you aren't.

00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:07.287
They are running away.

00:52:07.311 --> 00:52:10.101
I said I will take the lady.

00:52:32.391 --> 00:52:35.101
Eat this yeot, you thieves.

00:52:38.051 --> 00:52:41.167
<i>Yes, my type has always been</i>

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:43.951
<i>the supporting characters.</i>

00:52:48.881 --> 00:52:50.507
Why was a nobleman's daughter

00:52:50.531 --> 00:52:53.811
roaming in the mountains at night?

00:52:54.551 --> 00:52:56.477
You are the Chief State Minister's
daughter, correct?

00:52:56.501 --> 00:52:58.147
How did you know...

00:52:58.171 --> 00:52:59.541
To be honest,

00:53:00.391 --> 00:53:04.157
I stopped by the tea house
on the night of the full moon.

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:06.747
Y-You saw me at the tea house?

00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:08.197
Yes.

00:53:08.221 --> 00:53:12.217
You made drinks in such
a fun and satisfying way.

00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:15.471
It was so impressive
that I could not forget.

00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:17.647
<i>What's this?</i>

00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:20.771
<i>Jung Su Gyeom was there that night, too?</i>

00:53:22.051 --> 00:53:24.511
My film cut off that night.

00:53:25.431 --> 00:53:30.227
I mean, I cannot remember that night.

00:53:30.251 --> 00:53:33.947
Anyway, thank you for saving me.

00:53:33.971 --> 00:53:35.917
I do not know how to return the favor.

00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:38.347
You do not have to do anything special.

00:53:38.371 --> 00:53:40.521
But I have a request.

00:53:41.321 --> 00:53:43.457
Would you say yes?

00:53:43.481 --> 00:53:46.111
Of course. Tell me.

00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:49.327
Could you join the Seonmun Club

00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.307
that I created?

00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:53.027
Seonmun Club?

00:53:53.051 --> 00:53:55.617
<i>Seonmun Club is a drinking club</i>

00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:59.587
<i>disguised as an astrology
club started by him.</i>

00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:03.417
I have always been interested
in the sun, moon, and stars.

00:54:03.441 --> 00:54:06.277
I started the club to
study the celestial bodies'

00:54:06.301 --> 00:54:09.897
movements and discuss life and fate.

00:54:09.921 --> 00:54:13.577
<i>I know that's just an excuse to drink.</i>

00:54:13.601 --> 00:54:15.377
<i>Don't try to make it sound impressive.</i>

00:54:15.401 --> 00:54:17.317
<i>Jung Su Gyeom is smoother than I thought.</i>

00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:19.887
I heard the next full moon will be big.

00:54:19.911 --> 00:54:23.317
How about we enjoy your fascinating

00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:25.727
and unusual drinks together, then?

00:54:25.751 --> 00:54:29.777
<i>The cocktails made a great impact.</i>

00:54:29.801 --> 00:54:33.217
<i>But I'm running away now.</i>

00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:36.147
I appreciate the suggestion, sir.

00:54:36.171 --> 00:54:39.877
But a nobleman's daughter
can't leave home at night

00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:42.377
and drink on top of that.

00:54:42.401 --> 00:54:45.727
But if you want the
recipes for the cocktails,

00:54:45.751 --> 00:54:48.757
I'll write them down for you.

00:54:48.781 --> 00:54:50.057
You cannot.

00:54:50.081 --> 00:54:51.697
I want you to teach me everything

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:54.771
directly in person. And

00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:58.471
it is not about alcohol.

00:54:59.271 --> 00:55:01.057
Studying the sky is

00:55:01.081 --> 00:55:05.021
the most romantic thing
the current youth can enjoy.

00:55:06.171 --> 00:55:10.831
I want you to enjoy the
romantic experience, too.

00:55:18.851 --> 00:55:23.471
You will not say no to me, will you,
Maiden Sun Chaek?

00:55:26.501 --> 00:55:30.327
J-Just once, then.

00:55:30.351 --> 00:55:31.971
<i>I do not allow it.</i>

00:55:48.941 --> 00:55:50.401
Beon.

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:57.671
What brings you here?

00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:00.067
And what do you mean you will not allow?

00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:02.387
I am planning to ban all
the gatherings between

00:56:02.411 --> 00:56:06.661
unwed men and women of the capital for now.

00:56:07.611 --> 00:56:09.461
Why all of a sudden?

00:56:12.241 --> 00:56:15.691
There is something I need
to protect and manage.

00:56:23.001 --> 00:56:26.081
The yellow leaves are so nice.

00:56:28.321 --> 00:56:31.781
Ho Yeol, isn't that Sun Chaek?

00:56:34.321 --> 00:56:37.611
What are you all doing here?

00:56:38.901 --> 00:56:41.331
What are you doing here, then?

00:56:45.351 --> 00:56:47.377
You were here, too, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:56:47.401 --> 00:56:49.511
Let us greet you.

00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:52.057
Yes.

00:56:52.081 --> 00:56:55.721
Are you my future brothers-in-law?

00:56:59.391 --> 00:57:02.607
Brothers-in-law, did you say?

00:57:02.631 --> 00:57:04.327
I think you heard him wrong, Hyungnim.

00:57:04.351 --> 00:57:07.487
No, he heard me correctly.

00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:09.577
It sounds like your sister

00:57:09.601 --> 00:57:12.551
did not tell you anything.

00:57:13.551 --> 00:57:16.737
What strange things were
you talking about, anyway?

00:57:16.761 --> 00:57:21.267
I, Prince Gyeongseong,
will declare directly and openly.

00:57:21.291 --> 00:57:24.091
<i>Right now?</i>

00:57:26.011 --> 00:57:28.381
Your sister and I will soon.

00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:32.881
She will soon.

00:57:33.631 --> 00:57:36.087
Cover your ears. Cover your ears.

00:57:36.111 --> 00:57:38.837
- W-What...
- No, no!

00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:42.221
- She will soon-
- No!

00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:05.367
<i>This handsome psycho's
obsession for his first night</i>

00:58:05.391 --> 00:58:10.031
<i>will end when I die, it seems.</i>

00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:16.181
Sun Chaek!

00:58:23.821 --> 00:58:26.227
[Epilogue] Gosh, gosh...

00:58:26.251 --> 00:58:29.247
You should have watched
where you were going.

00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:32.467
Shit. What about you, then?

00:58:32.491 --> 00:58:34.297
Geez, should I hit you or not?

00:58:34.321 --> 00:58:36.087
- This is your fault.
- My fault?

00:58:36.111 --> 00:58:37.501
You little...

00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:47.927
Why are you doing this to us?

00:58:47.951 --> 00:58:49.707
We were just passing by.

00:58:49.731 --> 00:58:51.467
Do you know

00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:54.667
who you dared to threaten?

00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:58.237
She will become my wife soon.
Me, Prince Gyeongseong.

00:58:58.261 --> 00:59:00.087
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:59:00.111 --> 00:59:01.757
F-Forgive us.

00:59:01.781 --> 00:59:04.107
We were just trying to
feed ourselves to survive.

00:59:04.131 --> 00:59:09.287
By the way, she ran away
holding another man's hand.

00:59:09.311 --> 00:59:11.117
No, don't...

00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:13.777
If you did this to feed
yourselves and survive,

00:59:13.801 --> 00:59:16.137
I should get rid of your mouths first.

00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:18.041
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:21.137
S-Spare us!

00:59:21.161 --> 00:59:22.807
Beg him right now.

00:59:22.831 --> 00:59:25.867
Forgive us. Please spare us.

00:59:25.891 --> 00:59:27.657
We do not know what we did, but...

00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:30.137
<i>Y-You saw me at the tea house?</i>

00:59:30.161 --> 00:59:31.937
<i>It was so impressive
that I could not forget.</i>

00:59:31.961 --> 00:59:34.177
Consider yourselves lucky today.

00:59:34.201 --> 00:59:37.457
Thank you! Thank you!

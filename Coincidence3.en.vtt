00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.040
(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.040
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.040
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.360
(Presents)

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.960
(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.480
Are you sure this land
belongs to you?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.880
- I am.
- Wait.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.120
Why is it so empty?
It doesn’t look like his photos.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.600
- Look.
- What?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.560
I got the exact same photo.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.680
Ake.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.800
You scumbag!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.640
Let’s keep an eye on him

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.440
and find out where he hid our money.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
Hey.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.240
Try pressing play.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.840
What?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960
Wait.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.640
After we found out
that this guy scammed us,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.520
it took us a while to figure out
he is a professional romance scammer

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.320
who has scammed tons of women.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.520
The common factor
between all the victims

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.520
was that their late husbands
all had life insurance policies.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.160
He looks for victims by buying data
from insurance companies.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120
Hey.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.520
So, what would you like
to show me today?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.760
I have two cases for you.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.120
Both of the late husbands
paid a hefty premium.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960
And both died in an accident.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.440
The compensation
is through the roof.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920
Most importantly,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.080
the beneficiaries are still young.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
Wait.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.040
They are such big victims.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.680
I want a bigger cut.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.240
The bigger the case,
the riskier it gets.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.280
Tell me how much you want.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.720
I want five percent.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.320
Fine. If it's as much as you say,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.960
of course I can give you that.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.640
The first one’s a librarian
and still young.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.520
She should be easy to trick.
Nothing complicated.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.480
The second one
seems more experienced.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.160
She has a child.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.560
I saw she has insurance claims
at the hospital.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.720
You could probably approach her
through that.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.520
- And that’s where our story begins.
- And that’s where our story begins.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.680
I’ll be back.
I just have some errands to run.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.960
I don’t know what’s wrong.
He just ran out.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080
It was me.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.960
So I brought a surveillance camera.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560
Let’s keep an eye on him
and find out where he hid our money.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.280
Eight, nine, ten.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.000
You're buying so many.
Are they for kids?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400
No, they’re for adults.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.760
The real gold is here.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.120
You two can have the chocolate.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.600
The police took our statement,
but I’m not sure they'll act on it.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.080
They say
we willingly gave him money.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.600
But this is a fraud case.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.520
Mom, what’s the problem?
Why don’t you consult with Ake?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.760
He’s smart. He knows everything.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200
Come here, Preem.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.560
Ake and I got into a fight.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.880
He probably won’t visit us anymore.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080
Accept it, dear.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.680
Can’t you two make up?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520
Preem.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.760
Sometimes when adults fight,
it’s a really big fight.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.760
Too big to fix.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.840
But don’t be sad, Preem.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.640
You may not have Ake,
but you have me instead.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.120
But Mom told me
you used to bully her.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.120
That was a misunderstanding.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.760
Actually, Ake bullied me and Uea.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.640
Did Ake hurt you two badly?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.640
I guess we’re okay.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.240
This is the last piece, okay?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.800
Enough chocolate. I’ll make dinner.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.280
Okay, Mom.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.920
Are you alright?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.280
Why was I so stupid
to fall in love with him?

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.400
- I was so stupid. So, so stupid.
- Hey.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.720
You weren’t the only one.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.880
We were both stupid.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.800
I should have trusted myself.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.320
At first, I thought

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.760
if Preem didn’t have a dad

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.560
and our family didn’t have a strong
foundation, it’d be bad.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960
Look how things turned out.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.080
I didn’t believe in myself

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.920
that I could raise her on my own.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840
That’s why it ended up like this.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.560
I lost millions.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.240
I ruined her life with my own hands.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.840
It was me.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320
Hey.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.720
You’re not alone.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.200
I’m here with you.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.040
How about this,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.400
if you’re having money troubles,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.280
I can lend you some.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.640
I live alone. I don’t spend much.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.720
Thank you, Uea.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.480
I don’t want to be a burden.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240
Keep your money.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.960
You’ll need it in the future.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.960
But thank you.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.640
You’re making dinner, right?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.720
I’ll cook the rice.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.880
Hey, Dad.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.040
What's going on?

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.080
Why did you sell your store?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.600
I was scammed by
a call center gang.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.240
What?

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.280
You were scammed?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960
Yes.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.480
They claimed to be the police.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.880
They said I was involved
in a money laundering case.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.920
They threatened me

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.640
that if I didn’t transfer my money
for them to check,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.680
they’d seize the store.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.280
I was scared,
so I transferred the money.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.200
Oh, Dad...

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.960
Why didn’t you call me?
I could’ve helped you.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.520
I didn’t want you to get involved.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.760
I know you’re still upset
about your husband.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.560
You don’t usually answer my calls
anyway, do you?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.640
How did you fall for that?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.520
It’s all over the news.
Didn’t you see any of it?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.120
How could you be so stupid?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.520
All I could think about
was losing the store

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.160
and not having
anything left to leave you.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.160
I wasn’t thinking straight.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.600
If you want to call me stupid,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.880
I can accept that.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.840
Did you report it to the police?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.360
- Yes.
- What did they say?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.640
What do you think?

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600
Come on.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.760
Don't cry.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.760
Our lives don’t end here.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.160
You still have the money
your husband left you.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800
Dad.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.880
I was scammed by a man too.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.320
He made me fall in love with him,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.160
then he took my money.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.520
Now,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.800
I don’t have much left.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.160
I thought I was the only stupid one.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Turns out...

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.920
like father, like daughter.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760
But...

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.960
If you want to cry, just let it out.
You’ll feel better.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.960
I’ll get you something to eat.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.800
I felt so sorry for my dad.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.640
He was suffering so much at his age.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.920
As his daughter,
I couldn’t make it better.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.480
So I decided to fight once again.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.160
I don’t want to change schools.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.960
If I do,
I won’t get to see my friends.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.360
You’ll make new friends
at your new school.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920
- No.
- Don’t cry.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.720
I don’t want new friends.
I want my old friends.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.240
Preem, listen to me.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.960
We don’t have as much money
as we did when your dad was here.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.560
We need to save money.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.760
Your tuition is very expensive.
I can’t afford it.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920
Uea.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.000
You’re back
because you feel the same, right?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.080
You're thinking what I am thinking?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.360
Yes, why are we giving up?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.000
Let’s get our money back.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.040
The information
must have been cleared.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240
Let me try.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.440
Try pressing it.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.800
No, it doesn't work.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.360
- Try it again.
- Excuse me.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.040
Excuse me. You can't enter.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.960
The old tenant just moved out.
The room hasn’t been cleaned.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.720
Excuse me, do you remember me?

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.640
I lived here with my boyfriend.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.280
May I go in?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.960
No, the owner won’t allow it.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.200
But if you want to rent the room,
I can give you his number.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.320
No, I don’t want to.
I just want to get something.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.200
Something?

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.720
Is it that important?

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.280
My ring.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.640
He bought me a ring.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.160
Then we got into a fight,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.120
and I took it off out of spite.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.560
I’m not mad at him anymore.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.120
I just want my ring back.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.200
It’s the only thing
I have left from him.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.200
May I go in and get it, please?

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.080
Fine.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.440
But next time,
don't act impulsively.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Don’t take too long.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.400
I won’t.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480
Thank you.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.760
Wow, what a shame.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.880
Forget it.
Let’s look somewhere else.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.720
Phare, I found something.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560
It’s in here.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.920
One, two.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.920
I got it.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.080
- Uea, are you sure it's here?
- Yes?

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.200
I'm not sure.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.920
But everyone has
the same wristband as ours.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880
It's probably the right place.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.320
- Let’s go sit down.
- Okay.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960
What would you like?

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.640
Two glasses of wine.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.720
Let’s make a deal.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.800
If we see him,
you have to stay calm.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.720
Assess the situation,
then we’ll decide.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.960
If he runs,
we’ll never find him again.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.240
I know, I won’t mess things up.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200
The usual, please.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.760
Is it him?

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160
Yes.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480
It's him.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.760
Dressed like this,
I almost didn’t recognize him.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.360
I think he’s here
looking for his next victim.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.600
Let’s keep an eye on him.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.200
If the victim takes the bait, we’ll
call the police and expose him.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.000
Let's do that.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.760
What's going on?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.720
I don’t know, people just got up
and started dancing.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.360
Look!

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.880
What was that? I’m so confused.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.640
Don’t be confused.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.360
Wasn’t that obvious? He’s gay.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.240
Such a masculine gay guy?

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.320
When he was with me,
I never saw this side of him.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.560
A professional scammer
can play any role.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.640
But he was too good.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.000
There’s one thing he couldn’t fake.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.320
The sex.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.240
It's annoying. If he wants to dance
like that, do it at home.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.840
Then he can somersault all he wants.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.680
You're right, he disappeared
for a while.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.160
I thought some foreigner had
whisked him away.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.840
And now he suddenly shows up.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.560
What a letdown.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.440
He came alone, so he could dance
as much as he wanted.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.400
Why don’t we go dance up front
and block him?

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.480
Show him it’s not his stage.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.720
Excuse me.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160
What?

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.840
Do you know that guy
who was dancing like crazy?

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.800
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.480
Who doesn’t know Nhong?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.560
- Nhong?
- That's right.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.000
You said he has a sugar daddy.
What do you mean?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.920
Look at his social media.
He never posts about work

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.040
but is always shopping
and traveling.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.720
It’s pretty obvious,
don’t you think?

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.520
He earns a lot and spends a lot.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.720
He's always got
a few boyfriends on the go.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.160
It's not that he’s hot.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160
He gets dumped a lot,
so he has to keep changing.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.880
Oh dear.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.520
Do you have his social account?
Let me see it.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.440
- Nhong's?
- Show them.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.400
Go ahead, scroll.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.400
He lives a fabulous
and glamorous life.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.040
And who's this?

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.840
Oh.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.000
The ex he loved the most.
They broke up here.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.120
Nhong cried on the floor
like no one was watching.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.120
- How shameful.
- Yes.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
Let's go dance.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.280
- Come on.
- Let's go.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640
We have to go.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.440
It's private.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.680
If we send a follow request,
he’ll know we’re onto him.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.560
But... are you thinking
what I’m thinking?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
What is that?

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.080
He attacked our weakness.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.440
He used it against us.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.400
We should do the same.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.760
Fight fire with fire.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720
Yes.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.600
Exactly what I was thinking.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.960
Who are we going to use
to trick him?

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.360
Do you have any handsome
gay friends?

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.440
You probably know
some gay students at college.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200
Do you know anyone?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920
I know one.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.760
But he’s not gay.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.440
Wow, I didn't know someone
could be that evil.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.560
Has he ever physically abused you?

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.440
No.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.720
He just made me fall in love
and took my money.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.200
That’s bad enough.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.440
If he had hurt me too,
it might have been easier.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.320
Then I would have broken up
with him that day.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.280
But he was so nice to me.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.320
Where is he now?
Want me to beat him up?

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.400
A guy like him needs to face
a guy like me.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.680
Calm down.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.400
I’m here today

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.040
because I want to ask for your help.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.600
But I don’t want you to beat him up.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.360
How do you want me to help?

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.360
Just trick him
and get my money back.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Well...

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.440
It might be a big ask.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.920
If you can’t help me,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.120
I understand.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.920
I just want to use your social media
to say hi and get close to him.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.280
That’s not a big deal.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.080
Go ahead, I don’t mind.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.320
Hold on.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.680
I already sent you
my username and password.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.320
Thank you so much.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.040
I promise I’ll be very careful.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.720
I won’t get you into trouble.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640
Okay.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440
Uea.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.440
When do you want to meet up again?

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.080
Just go to class. I’ll let you know.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.880
Sure.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.560
He accepted the request.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120
He followed us back.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.120
All right, let’s get started.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.560
You've got such a nice body.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.280
Teach me how to work out.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.360
(You've got such a nice body.
Teach me how to work out.)

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.200
Don’t message me randomly.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.040
"Don’t message me randomly."

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.160
What should we do?
He doesn’t seem to like it.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.840
I like people who are serious.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.480
"I like people who are serious."

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.760
We still have hope.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.720
I’m serious.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.080
I’m James.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.600
What’s your name?

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.600
(I’m serious. I’m James.
What’s your name?)

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040
I'm Nhong.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720
Are you a student?

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760
What year are you in?

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800
Sophomore.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.520
What do you do for a living?

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.080
I’ll be doing an internship
next year.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.520
Maybe you can give me some advice.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.400
I'm an investor.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.520
Wow.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.360
So that means you’re loaded.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.920
I’ve got enough to get by.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.880
Maybe you can give me
some investment advice sometime.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.560
(Maybe you can give me
some investment advice sometime.)

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.480
People who aren’t close don’t give
each other investment advice.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:54.400
Is it hard to get close to you?

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.320
What? He sent an emoji.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.440
What now?

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.400
Scammers have to keep
their guard up.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.120
He doesn’t want people taking
advantage of him the way he does.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.880
It’ll take time for him
to let his guard down.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.000
- For now, we’ll just talk nonsense.
- Sure.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120
Otherwise, he might get suspicious.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.240
Is this plan not working?

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.040
It’s been a week.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.000
We’re still stuck at "Good morning,
what are you up to?" "Good night."

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.840
(Do I look cute as a puppy?)

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.000
I’m thinking of using this approach.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.840
I’m going to upload
a story of James to flirt.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.360
Not sure if he’ll take the bait.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.960
Try it. We’ve got to try
everything now.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.760
I'm bored.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.720
I want to go out.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.720
Please take the bait.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.360
I’m going to Kari tomorrow.
Are you in?

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.760
Yes.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.080
Uea.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.080
How could you say that?
Who’s going to meet up with him?

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.120
Who else? We’ll send James.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.360
Did you ask him?

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.680
I’ll go meet Nhong.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.760
You already said yes.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.520
I can’t mess this up.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.840
Thank you, James.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.560
Phare, please tell him
what you want him to find out.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.040
- I’ll go get some water.
- Okay.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.800
I can tell.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.240
What do you mean?

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.280
You like Uea, don’t you?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.360
Do you know what her type is?

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.360
I don’t know. What do you think?

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040
Well...

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.640
Look at her late husband.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.880
He liked extreme sports.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.400
He was into paramotoring.
That’s crazy.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.400
If you want to win her over,

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.640
you might have to risk
doing something extreme.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.760
Okay, tell me how far
you want me to go with Nhong.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.200
Do whatever it takes
to make him fall for you,

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.880
make him open up and trust you,

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.760
until he tells you everything.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.400
Hello, are you James?

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.360
Yes. Hello, Nhong.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.120
You don’t have to be so formal.
It makes me feel old.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.240
You look even more handsome
in person, James.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.560
You’re not looking too bad yourself.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560
Thank you.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.160
The usual, please.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.760
Let me ask you something.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.680
Are you really gay, James?

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.360
Of course. Why do you ask?

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.920
I saw your lifestyle
on social media.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.840
You just don’t seem gay.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.840
Especially in person.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.360
The way you move, your style,
the way you talk.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.320
You don’t come off as gay.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.440
Tell me the truth.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.000
If you’re not gay,
we’re just wasting our time.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.640
Whatever I am,
I don’t think it needs a label.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.920
What do you mean?

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.040
Well... I had
a girlfriend in high school.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.560
It was puppy love.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.560
Then in my first year of college,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.840
I had a crush on a senior.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.640
I chased her for a long time.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.000
I highlighted quotes
in books for her,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.320
but she just wasn’t into me.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.640
Oh, James.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.080
When someone doesn’t like you,

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.560
no matter what you do,
they still won’t.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:31.200
So, have you decided
if you’re straight or gay?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.160
Well...

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.360
I don’t know.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.000
It feels like
I’m stuck in the middle.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.000
I suck at being straight,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.120
and I’m like an amateur
at being gay.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.200
It’d be nice

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880
if I had an advisor.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.440
Come on, James.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.560
Don’t flirt with me.
I know what you're up to.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.160
James.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.920
I love this song! Let’s go dance.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.560
I don’t know how.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.720
I’ll teach you, come on.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.160
- You sure?
- Yes.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.160
Hello, Nhong. What's up?

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.480
Where are you, James?

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.840
I’m at college,
about to go to class.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.680
Are you in front of the building?

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.760
Yes, why?

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.400
Look to the left of the stairs.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.680
Do you see a book?

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.480
Yes, what about it?

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.960
Open it and read it. That’s all.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.680
Huh?

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:26.040
("Quotes About Love")

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.920
"I didn’t think
I’d fall in love at first,"

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.320
"but before I knew it,
I already had."

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.360
"I may fall in love easily,"

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.400
"but I’m sincere
with everyone I love."

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.040
"Even after all the pain,
meeting you made me realize"

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.720
"you’re the one who can heal me."

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.160
Happy first month.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.000
Will you come to my room
tomorrow night?

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.000
Should we stop here, Uea?

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.880
We’ve been trying for months
with no progress.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.200
Let him live his own life.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.280
I’m afraid
things might get out of hand.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.200
But James is at a point
we’ve never reached before.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.480
They’ve been dating for a month,
and he hasn't asked for money.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.080
He’s the only one paying.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.920
That means he’s taken our bait.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.360
It’d be a shame to stop now.
Just a little longer.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.920
James, what do you think?

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.480
Are you up for going to his room?

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.640
I can do it.
I’ll go to Nhong’s room.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.600
There’s nothing to lose.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.960
I’m a guy.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.280
It’s no big deal.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.240
Thank you, James.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.560
Try it and see if you like it.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.520
Wow, it’s really good.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.480
I’m not a picky eater.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.040
Did you make all this?

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680
Yes.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.000
Just tell me what you want to eat.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.000
I can make anything.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.040
Cheers.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920
James.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.240
Do you remember what I told you?

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.360
I have plans to move to the States.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.520
I’ve been saving up
for over ten years.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.680
I’m ready to go.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280
What?

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.400
You’re leaving? When?

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.480
I can leave anytime.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.840
I can even go tomorrow.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.160
It depends on you.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.320
Why are you so sure it has to be me?

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.200
Because everyone I’ve dated,

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.720
no one really wanted me.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.440
Everyone

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.760
left me after they got the money
they wanted from me.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.160
But you, James,

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.040
you make me feel

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.400
like you want nothing from me.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.680
So, I think

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.720
this is true love.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.400
But I’m not sure
if you feel the same.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.840
Yes, I feel exactly the same.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.680
Nhong.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.880
What was that, James?
I don’t get it.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.200
If you’re not trying to deceive me,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.440
then you’re just wasting my time.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.440
I don’t mean to deceive you.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.400
Before you can lie to me,

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.320
you better lie to yourself first.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.960
Nhong, it’s not like that.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.120
You just caught me off guard.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.720
Now that you’ve gotten
yourself together,

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.040
you’re ready?

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.440
Nhong.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.080
It’s obvious.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.520
You’re like the rest of them.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.680
You just want to leech off me,
but won’t get serious.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.560
It’s not like that. I’m just...

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.720
I’m not a child.
I don't have time to waste.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.800
If you don’t want to get serious,
then just leave.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.560
I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.480
Yes, apologize and get out.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120
Get out.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.960
If you want to win her over,

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.800
you might have to risk
doing something extreme.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.160
Thank you, James.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200
Why did you come back?

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.880
I want to tell you the truth.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.240
What truth?

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.480
I love you.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.080
Some people end up getting
used and deceived

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.640
because they put their hearts
in the wrong hands.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.160
So where did he hide the money?

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.800
Actually, it’s not money.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.160
It’s gold.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.360
He showed it to me.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.160
Tim.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.880
It’s a shame our love wasn’t real.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.240
But if you went through
what I went through,

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080
you’d understand.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.800
Catch him!

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.600
Go. Don't wait for me!

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.720
Let's go.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.360
You did everything

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.920
to win over Uea, didn't you?

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.400
Don’t lie to yourself, James.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.120
People always expect something
in return for what they do.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520
He followed us back.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.280
All right, let’s get started.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400
Right?

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.760
Let's get started.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.840
Yes.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.600
I brought two women
to check out the land

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.960
and gave them the same dream.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.840
I'm a scammer.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200
A true con artist.

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:45.451

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.749
=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.860
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.900
=Episode 12=

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.360
Do you know what you did wrong?

00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:29.150
Because I kept traveling back and forth
through the same timeline

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.000
to save my friend,

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.520
a lot of innocent people

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.400
ended up dying.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.879
That's not all.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.719
Your repeated crossings

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.240
warped that timeline.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.759
The distortion caused energy anomalies

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.360
that affected the items
in Qin Ziyi's Treasure Trove.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:52.511
Those objects were thrown into timelines
where they never should've existed.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.080
Do you understand what that leads to?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.280
No, I don't.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.599
Should these objects emerge
in other timelines without detection,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.960
the risk remains limited.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.759
But once someone
picks them up or uses them,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.400
it introduces variables into their fate.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.080
Their life path shifts.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.639
That shift can be small or massive.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.759
It's like throwing a stone

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.439
into calm water.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.120
The ripples keep spreading,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.439
one turning into many,

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.400
many turning into countless,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.639
and eventually, countless lives
are affected.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.280
It wasn't
until I reached Tianguang Market

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:32.470
that I realized
the timeline tied to Yashe

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.800
had already been torn to shreds

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.719
because of

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.080
my selfishness and obsession.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.879
Order collapsed.
Time itself was thrown into chaos.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.159
This is the gravest taboo
in time travel.

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.599
My sins run deep.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.039
I ask you

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.560
to give me a chance

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.719
to make things right.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.759
Though I'm the Market Lord here,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.759
I'm also part
of the Time Administration.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.040
Seeing that you truly repent,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360
I can offer you a chance

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.600
to redeem yourself on their behalf.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.040
Thank you, Market Lord.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.639
You may use the time elevator
to retrieve the scattered artifacts

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.399
from the wrong timelines

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.560
and return them where they belong

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.560
to minimize further damage.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.279
Can you do that?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.279
Yes,

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:53.560
I can.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.920
Market Lord,

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.839
this goes against
Time Administration protocol.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.560
Let him earn redemption
through merit, just this once.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.439
Bring the prepared items.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.120
Guards.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.480
This outfit will keep you alive.

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.920
(I finally understood.)

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.720
(The mistakes of the past)

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.319
(can't be undone.)

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.800
(The dead can never be brought back.)

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.839
(From that moment on,)

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.040
(my mission began.)

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.680
(I traveled through
countless timelines,)

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.319
(searching for Ziyi's treasures.)

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.079
I built this Treasure Trove.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.360
Once it's filled,

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:29.360
my journey through time ends.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.959
(Treasure Trove)
That's why

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.360
I can't allow anyone

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.360
to repeat my mistake.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.319
I didn't know
you carried a past like that.

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.480
I thought someone as powerful as you

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.399
wouldn't have worries.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.800
I'm sorry.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.800
I shouldn't have used Yashe
without permission.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.839
I was wrong.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.519
I won't do it again.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.920
Let me stay with you

00:07:26.422 --> 00:07:28.360
and help you finish what you need to do.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.720
Please?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.000
Even if everything I do

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.360
brings misfortune to others,

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:42.720
even if I have to leave in the end,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.399
would you still want to stay?

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:49.920
You could stay here, too.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.319
It's fine as long as we don't alter
the fate of historical figures, right?

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.519
I'm not some figure of history.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.160
I don't have a destiny worth changing.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.800
Once everything's over,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.120
you could live

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.199
in our era

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.720
and experience life here.

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:14.120
You still don't understand.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.800
Come with me.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800
Are you taking me to see someone?

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:32.039
What is this place?

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.799
This is Huai City.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.639
When spring is at its best,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.440
scholars from the Imperial Academy
gather here,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.240
carrying their scrolls, trading books,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.720
and debating ideas.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.120
Huai City...

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.200
Are those locust trees?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.720
Yes.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.960
In mid-spring,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.399
white petals

00:08:58.679 --> 00:08:59.879
fill the city

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.440
like falling frost.

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:05.480
So...

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360
you brought me here to see the flowers?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.919
Is he dead?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.519
That's the carriage and coachman
from Qin Residence.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.919
Why did you bring me here?

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:31.759
I need you to understand

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.039
why the past can't be changed.

00:09:57.244 --> 00:09:59.911
Back then, I was the one
who sent Caiwei with the message.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.039
It led to her death here.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:07.679
I never even
had the chance to look for her.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.120
To save one person,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.679
so many innocent lives were lost.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.519
Let's bury her together.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.799
Caiwei!

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.799
Caiwei!

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.279
Young Master...

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.559
You saved our young master.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.559
Thank goodness...

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.639
I'm sorry

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.440
I failed your trust.

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:05.919
The Dushan Jade

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.080
was stolen by thieves.

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:11.879
Please

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.519
look after

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.840
our young master...

00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:41.679
Do I really look

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.840
that much like Mr. Qin?

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.039
Look over there.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.580
(Yashe)

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.639
You should go.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.080
Then...

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:16.840
I'll head back and walk Tuanzi.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:21.240
Su Beilu.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.000
Don't stay at Yashe anymore.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.039
I...

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.000
I know what I did wrong.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.960
I won't do it again.

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:54.159
Please

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.799
don't make me leave.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.799
You can live in that apartment.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.866
Take your time finding another job.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:09.519
This job matters a lot to me.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.000
I mean,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.240
we've been
working better together, haven't we?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.360
You even praised me last time.

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:24.360
Can't you give me another chance?

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.799
How many chances
have I already given you?

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.240
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.279
I'm telling you to leave.

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:42.320
Go.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.000
Leave this place. Leave Yashe.

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.200
What have you ever brought me

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.440
other than trouble?

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:53.440
I know.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:56.360
I know you took me back

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:57.799
so I'd understand

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:59.960
how serious the consequences
of changing the past are.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.320
I didn't know so many people would die.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.679
Now I do.

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:04.879
I swear I'll never do it again.

00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:06.600
You still don't get it!

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.200
This is all my fault.

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:12.000
I was wrong.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.320
It's my fault.

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:16.600
I never should've dragged you into this.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.399
Go.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.840
Leave.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.519
Get out of here!

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:33.879
Tuanzi,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.240
I can spend the whole day
with you today.

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:39.399
Happy?

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.159
Actually,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.879
I'll be able to spend every day
with you from now on.

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:49.200
I lost my job again.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.639
You don't have to comfort me.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.879
It's not the first time anyway.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.960
Everything I do

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.159
turns into a mess.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.200
I can't do anything right,

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.920
so maybe it's better
not to do anything at all.

00:17:09.088 --> 00:17:10.911
If I don't do anything,
I can't mess it up.

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:12.799
Right, Tuanzi?

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:41.079
(Not even junk food
gives me joy anymore.)

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.640
Tuanzi,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.279
do you want to go outside?

00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:16.533
This way. Go straight,
and then turn right.

00:18:16.533 --> 00:18:17.720
(Chongle Pet Hospital)

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.519
Hello.

00:18:26.079 --> 00:18:26.759
Tuanzi,

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.680
do you miss the people at the hospital?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.200
Forget it.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.400
Let's not bother them.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.640
Come on.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.160
Min,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.599
help me register this.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.680
Su Beilu!

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.359
Why didn't you come in?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.880
Have you eaten yet?

00:19:03.359 --> 00:19:04.279
It's my treat.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.039
Order whatever you want.

00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:15.640
Come on.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.960
Order anything you want.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.500
(Luosifen Combo)

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.920
Sir,

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:23.359
you're too generous.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.039
You're my student.

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:27.480
Don't be polite with me.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.039
Take a seat.

00:19:31.844 --> 00:19:32.688
Order what you want.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.119
Anything is fine.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.799
We're ready to order.

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:37.599
Go ahead.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.359
Two bowls of Luosifen.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.400
Got it.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:41.920
Add fried egg,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.680
beef balls,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.030
duck feet, and pig trotters.

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:44.440
Sir,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.519
that's too much.

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:46.720
Don't hold back.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.640
We want the everything combo!

00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:50.110
Sure thing.

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.319
And stir-fry some greens.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.559
Two sodas, too.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.680
You want yours cold or room temperature?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.440
We can't eat that much.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.200
Make it chilled!

00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:02.777
Here you go.

00:20:02.777 --> 00:20:03.480
Enjoy.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.240
Thank you.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.799
Thanks.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.079
Sir, the thing is,

00:20:10.759 --> 00:20:12.279
I'm out of a job again.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.319
Don't address me so politely.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.359
In this area,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.799
you're my master.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.680
Here.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.960
Congratulations on job hunting again.

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:32.519
Sir.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:36.680
Am I really

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:38.880
that useless?

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.440
I used to not think much.

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:48.599
You told me what to do
and I just did it.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.119
The vet exam

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.720
was for work,

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:53.920
so I took it.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.559
But...

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.400
But I'm not smart enough.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:58.480
I couldn't pass.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.799
I didn't think I was useless.

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:05.119
I just thought

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:07.880
I hadn't worked hard enough.

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:10.480
After leaving the hospital,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.799
I fixed a lot of my bad habits.

00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:16.799
I wanted to do well at my new job.

00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:21.319
But in the end,

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:23.720
I still messed it up.

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.279
Sir.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.720
Do you think I'm a failure, too?

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:42.759
Su.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:43.680
Here.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.200
Look at this bowl of Luosifen.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.599
What would a rich person say?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.000
They'd say,

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:50.200
"Tang,

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:51.559
you're treating us

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:53.559
and this is all you ordered?"

00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:56.279
What would someone without money say?

00:21:56.759 --> 00:21:57.720
They'd say,

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.110
"It's just a bowl of noodles.

00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:01.440
Why did you order all the extras

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:03.160
and waste money?"

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.519
But

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:08.119
how does it feel after eating it?

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:11.079
I decide that.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:13.400
It's good,

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:14.839
it's worth it,

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.480
and I'm happy.

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:22.160
So am I useless or not?

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.759
Why do you care so much
about what I think?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.960
It doesn't matter whether others think
you're useless or not.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.079
That's just their version of you.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.279
You should live as the kind of person
you don't think is useless.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.480
If it's not enough yet,

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:39.000
then keep working at it.

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:41.160
That's all there is to it.

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:43.559
Got it, boy?

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:47.640
Eat up.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Have some vegetables.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.440
Thank you, Sir.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:51.839
Here.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.000
(Spicy Or Not, It's Your Call)

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.759
Have some vegetables too, Sir.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.640
Tuanzi,

00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:12.920
you don't want to leave either, do you?

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.000
But we've got to rely on ourselves.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.359
We can't depend on others forever.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.799
Don't worry.

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:23.200
I'll find a better job

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.680
on my own

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.440
and get you a nicer place to live.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.160
All right.

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:31.559
I'm packing up now.

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:32.720
Go play outside.

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.319
Go on.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.480
What a clever dog.

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.640
You even know to tell me

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.920
to pack your toys.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.799
Go and play.

00:24:10.519 --> 00:24:11.359
Tuanzi!

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:12.799
Tuanzi!

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:15.119
That's Bizhi's.

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:18.240
I know you'll miss Bizhi, too,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.200
but we can't keep bothering him.

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.200
Tuanzi!

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:37.440
That's Bizhi's, too.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.720
What's wrong with you?

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:40.240
We're leaving, you know that?

00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:42.279
We have to rely on ourselves now.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.119
We're on our own now.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.519
All right.

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:50.200
Go play.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:59.160
Tuanzi!

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:04.279
Oh, no.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.599
Don't chew that!

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.400
Move over.

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:38.119
Here.

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:41.119
Don't fall asleep.

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:48.200
Don't move.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.920
Help is on the way.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.100
(Yashe)

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.039
Is anyone in?

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.519
Bizhi!

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.119
Bizhi, are you in there?

00:26:56.839 --> 00:26:58.440
Bizhi, I need to talk to you.

00:26:59.119 --> 00:26:59.920
Bizhi!

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.400
Bizhi, are you in there?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.440
Open up!

00:27:04.599 --> 00:27:05.440
Is anyone in?

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.160
Bizhi!

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.620
(Yashe)

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.400
Bizhi.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.559
Bizhi.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.880
You didn't leave.

00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:48.759
When I went back,

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.119
Tuanzi kept barking,

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:52.759
so I had to bring him out.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.720
That person was you,

00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:03.079
wasn't it?

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:10.440
The man who pulled me out of the car

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:11.680
was you,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.599
wasn't it?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.079
I never thought

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.039
that kid from back then was you.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:34.279
I always believed

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.279
I was the unluckiest guy in the world.

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:40.759
But starting today,

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.000
I don't think that anymore.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.200
You wanted to push me away

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.039
because you were afraid
you'd bring me misfortune,

00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:49.440
like what happened to Caiwei.

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:51.599
Don't talk about yourself like that.

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:53.279
You're a good man.

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:54.759
You matter.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.119
Without you,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.160
there wouldn't be
someone called Su Beilu,

00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:05.119
and Tuanzi wouldn't be

00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:07.400
this healthy.

00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:10.079
Chun Ge and Min

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.400
would've lost a friend.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920
And you wouldn't have

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.559
had such an easy time
collecting antiques either.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.440
Right?

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:33.960
Let's say that's true.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.160
Save me some pride.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.599
I didn't drive you away

00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:50.160
because you used Yashe
without permission,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.400
or because I was afraid
of bringing you bad luck.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.960
I was afraid
you'd become who I used to be.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.319
You had already forgotten the past.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.400
My appearance

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:10.680
gave you hope again.

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:15.160
When I looked at you that day,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.119
it was like seeing my old self.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.000
I was afraid you'd live

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.200
your whole life burdened by the regret
of not saving your parents.

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:41.480
Honestly,

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:47.240
if I could,

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.279
I'd still want to save my parents.

00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:53.480
But now I know

that if I went back,

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:59.400
I'd change so much
of what's happening now.

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.799
I want my parents to live,

00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:02.960
but that

00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:05.119
would mean

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.759
I wouldn't return to Ninghai,

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.160
wouldn't live with my grandmother,

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:15.680
and wouldn't meet you.

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:21.799

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:28.599
I've had a lot of happy

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:31.000
and unforgettable moments.

00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:33.590

who I am.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.319
So

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:40.640
I don't want to change the past anymore.

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:44.599

Then you fill it in with red, yellow,

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.000
green, and purple pigments.

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:08.639
Then, it's fired at a low temperature,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.719

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:48.599
Thank you

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.679
for letting me stay at Yashe.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.880
Thank you

00:37:57.239 --> 00:37:58.360
for letting me stay here.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.800
Cheers!

00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:07.440
My Qing dynasty rosary!

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.880
What did you do to it?

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.719
Let me see.

00:38:10.066 --> 00:38:11.280
Grab some tissue.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.119
This is basically

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:13.920
ruined for good.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.320
This thing can't get wet.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.639
Sorry, Master Dong.

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:21.440
This is nice.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.760
Tuanzi.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.919
Don't worry.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.199
I will

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.199
give you a home.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.719
Allow me.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.400
Thank you.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:46.479
Here, Sir.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.319
I'm telling you.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.400
The house I got for you

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.429
is a great deal. It's right in front.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.933
(Ninghai City Map of Houses for Rent)

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Can you find another house for me?

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.719
The previous ones were barely habitable.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.759
Yes.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.000
I don't have a high budget,

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.919
but can you find a house
that's actually habitable?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.599
This house is great.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.639
Nice layout,

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.439
huge space,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.960
and great lighting.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.360
And a comfy bed.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.319
But are you sure a nice house like this

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.879
only costs so little to rent?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.960
Keep us safe...

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.400
Something happened

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.719
in this house before.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.000
That's why it's such a bargain.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.800
Mister,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.800
are we closing down?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.400
Don't jinx me like that.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.560
We're just moving.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.870
Moving?

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.759
Stop idling around.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.759
Give us a hand.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.960
Okay.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.520
Mister,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.800
your new home is awesome.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.800
It's a five-room apartment, right?

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:18.000
Look at the beautiful
Chinese-style furnishings

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.866
and the central air-conditioning system.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.040
It's a huge house.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.888
Doesn't it feel creepy
to live here alone?

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.600
If this is the dorm for
Yashe's employees,

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:26.839
it won't be that huge.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.120
Yashe's employees?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.720
I'm the only employee, right?

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.079
Tuanzi and Xuan Wu
are our employees too.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.560
This place accepts pets.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.920
Then you mean

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.240
I don't need

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.439
to find a house anymore?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.120
I can move here

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.800
with Tuanzi, right?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.600
Mister,

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.040
you're amazing!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.240
You don't know

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.079
how tiring it is to find a house!

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.600
Then, do I have to

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:54.839
pay rent?

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.439
I'll deduct it from your pay.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.160
No problem!

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.720
Mister,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.279
I will work hard!

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.079
What else do I need to carry?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.800
Tuanzi,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.519
we have a home!

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.860
(Yashe)

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.279
Anyone?

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.279
Yes.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.959
Please come in.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.480
What do you want to...

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.079
This place is huge.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.800
Hello.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.639
I seek treatment.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.600
It's so quaint in here.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.959
Excuse me,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.160
is this a souvenir store?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.120
You can see it that way.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.279
Take a look around.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.759
Sure.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.749
It's an antique store.
Su Beilu mentioned it before.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.577
An antique store?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.560
Do people really buy this kind of stuff?

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.240
I heard that antique stores like this,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.839
for every item they sell,

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.600
can survive for
another three years.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600
There's a turtle here.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.240
Isn't this medicine from our hospital?

00:05:58.266 --> 00:06:00.290
(Chongle Pet Hospital)
Isn't this our hospital's bag?

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:01.319
Xuan Wu!

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.839
I remember you!

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.720
You're the old guy
who got dragged out that day.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.519
Old guy?

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.480
What a coincidence, old guy.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.360
Long time no see.

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.519
Are you here

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.600
to buy something?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.639
No.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.439
We're here to look for someone.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.319
Mister,

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.879
I've finally finished pulling the weeds,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.279
and I've fed Xuan Wu.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.519
I'm pooped.

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:30.079
You're here.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:30.680
Mister,

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.199
I'm meeting them for dinner.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.829
Can I leave early today?

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.044
You want to leave work early?

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.244
I'll deduct that from your pay.

00:06:37.244 --> 00:06:38.630
No.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.600
I mean,

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.639
you can order takeaway and eat here.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.000
Is that really okay?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.000
Thank you, Mister.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
What do you want to eat?

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.199
Anything.

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.879
So, you're Su Beilu's boss.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.120
What a nice coincidence.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.399
Actually, Beilu is

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.000
a kind-natured person.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.399
Yes.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.240
He's a diligent worker.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.240
And very friendly too.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.720
Yes.

00:07:04.777 --> 00:07:06.190
When he was working at our hospital,

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:07.720
he got along well

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.879
with his colleagues

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and customers.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.279
Even animals love him.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.480
He's a people person.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.399
Yeah.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.800
But

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.639
no one is perfect.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.240
Everyone has flaws.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.600
He's not really that flawed.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.360
He is.

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.160
We need to be humble.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.639
At least one example.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.519
Yeah.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.560
So, we're nitpicking here.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.240
Su Beilu

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.000
can be

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.800
a little

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.600
rash.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.279
Not really.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.000
He's just a little...

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.319
intolerant of evil.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.240
Yeah.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:45.600
When he left the hospital,

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.079
the problem wasn't exactly with him.

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.639
It's got nothing to do with him.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.439
It's our manager

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:52.629
who doesn't like him.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.844
He's not exactly a good person.

00:07:53.844 --> 00:07:54.720
That's right.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.360
Understood.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.439
I hired him because

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.079
I admired his character too.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.839
He's blessed to have friends like you.

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:03.399
Dinner's here!

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:06.000
What were you talking about?

00:08:06.022 --> 00:08:06.900
Good things about you.

00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:07.830
Yeah, don't worry.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.040
Enjoy your food.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:09.879
I won't bother you.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:10.959
Mister, let's eat together.

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:11.600
I bought extra.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.079
Yeah.

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:12.959
Let's eat together.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:13.560
No.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.360
Enjoy.

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:16.920
You're really not eating, Mister?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:17.920
Fine.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.000
Time to unbox.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:20.959
Your boss is a nice guy.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:21.519
Yeah.

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.040
Look at this bullfrog.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.450
I queued up for a long time for it.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.839
Can you eat bullfrog?

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.720
Of course.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.459
I don't.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.560
You're scared of bullfrogs?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.120
But you look like one.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.200
What do you mean?

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.679
You look like one yourself.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.000
This bullfrog tastes amazing.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.311
I've been craving it.
Min, you like bullfrog, right?

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.970
- It's getting late.
- I'm okay with it.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.080
Come on.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.039
I need to eat now.

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:46.960
I'm starving.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:47.919
Tomatoes.

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:48.720
Try some, Min.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.039
It tastes nice.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:51.720
Tasty, right?

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:53.240
Try some.

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:54.600
It does taste great.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.790
The eggs are nicely cooked too.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.220
It's just a little too scrambled up.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.240
Try the mushrooms.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.000
Freshly harvested.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.159
Just harvested?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.200
You're already leaving?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.559
Yeah.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:16.879
We still need to work tomorrow.

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:17.679
Yeah.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:19.639
We'll take the trash out.

00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:21.488
Bye.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.159
Mister?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.759
Mister?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.039
Why did he drink so much?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.519
Mister?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.720
Mister?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320
Let me help you.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.840
Up you go.

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.480
Are you okay?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.440
I need to take a nap.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.399
Careful.

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:53.080
Watch the step.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.639
Careful.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:55.720
You should go back now.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.519
I'm okay.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.720
Are you really okay?

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.720
You might catch a cold like this.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.039
Then, I'm

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:16.039
going now.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.039
No.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720
Just this once.

00:12:24.733 --> 00:12:26.311
There's a dance performance over there.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.320
That's all for now.

00:12:28.422 --> 00:12:29.630
Let's check that place out.

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:30.519
Okay.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.919
(If I simply approached someone
to ask them what date today is,)

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.960
(they might think I'm mad.)

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:52.879
(Photo booth?)

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.559
(They should display the time here.)

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.799
(Touch screens don't exist right now.)

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:12.720
No date?

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.519
(Today is 12 October 2005.)

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:21.840
(Proudly developed by China,)

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.840
(Shenzhou 6, designed
for human spaceflight,)

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.440
(has successfully lifted off
at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.)

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.288
(It is expected to be
in orbit for five days.)

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.320
(The spacecraft was placed at
an inclination of 42.4 degrees...)

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.960
(2005?)

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.519
(I'm back.)

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:35.279
(Dad.)

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:35.879
(Mom.)

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.679
(Wait for me!)

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.620
(Huayang Kindergarten No. 3)

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.679
Bye.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.559
Bye.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:58.519
Bye.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.759
Bei.

00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:20.039
Bei.

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:21.919
Bei!

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.080
Mommy!

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.919
Bei.

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:25.799
I'm sorry.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.759
I'm sorry.

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.759
I'm late.

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:28.879
You must have waited long.

00:14:28.977 --> 00:14:30.644
There's a major operation
at the hospital.

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:32.120
Everyone was busy.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.480
Your dad was the chief surgeon.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.039
So, after the operation,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.960
the patient will recover?

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:38.960
Of course.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.120
Have you forgotten?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.799
Your father is Dr. Monkey King.

00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:42.679
When he's there,

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:44.320
the demons will be gone.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.279
Amazing, right?

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:45.960
Yeah.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.720
Mom, I'm amazing too.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.519
Look at the origami dog I made.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:52.120
Fantastic!

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.879
You have improved.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.360
Will you give it to me?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.960
Sure.

00:14:56.039 --> 00:14:57.919
Why don't you name it?

00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:01.519
It has a round face, just like yours.

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.200
Let's call it

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:03.600
Little Tuanzi.

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:04.879
Tuanzi.

00:15:04.933 --> 00:15:05.480
Is that okay?

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.320
Little Tuanzi.

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:07.679
Okay.

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:08.759
Let's go back now.

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:10.720
We need to depart early tomorrow.

00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:15.679
Fang Linlin!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.000
You are?

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.320
I...

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.460
I am...

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.879
I am...

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.600
a teacher in the kindergarten.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.720
Are you Su Beilu's mother?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.480
Yes.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.519
I've never seen him before.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.759
Then...

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.799
I'm the new intern.

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:47.720
It's possible that the kids
don't know me yet.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.039
Hello, Sir.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:51.159
Is there anything you need from me?

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.600
Here's the thing.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.759
As an intern, I've been assigned a task.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:00.440
I need to learn about
the children's weekend plans.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.480
So, I'd like to know

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.399
what you're planning

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:05.600
to do this weekend.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.320
We're going to Ninghai this weekend!

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.759
Yes.

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:11.919
Ninghai?

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.240
It's a great place.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.799
That's where I'm from, too.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.200
But...

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.559
You're from there, too?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.279
Then we're fellow townsfolk.

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.200
Please keep a close eye

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.320
on Bei in the kindergarten.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.080
We need to go now, Sir.

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:25.550
Let's go.

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:26.080
I...

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:30.879
Wait!

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.799
Is there anything?

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:38.720
Can you

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.480
go to Ninghai next week instead?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.519
Next week?

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:45.240
Why?

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.720
Does the kindergarten
have any arrangements?

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:49.759
No, not at all.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.519
But...

00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:52.320
You're planning to drive there, right?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.720
Yes.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.200
I heard

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:58.960
that there are roadworks
on the way to Ninghai.

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.600
It might be a bumpy ride.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.559
If you go next week instead,

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:03.679
it'd be a smoother journey.

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:05.000
Thank you for the reminder,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.290
but we've planned everything out.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.288
We're going anyway.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.799
We need to go home now.

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:09.799
Say goodbye.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.960
Bye, Sir.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960
Goodbye.

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:14.559
Mind the step.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.440
Slowly.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:16.960
Well?

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.920
Did you have fun
at the kindergarten today?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.279
Look.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:33.200
Who's back?

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:34.920
Daddy!

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:36.039
Slowly, Bei.

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.240
You're back!

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.680
Bei.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.400
Have you behaved yourself?

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.359
- Tell me.
- Slowly.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.359
I have.

00:17:43.066 --> 00:17:44.030
Let's go home for dinner.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.622
I want to watch "The Monkey King".

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.160
Okay.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.160
The Monkey King it is.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:49.400
You spoil him.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.789
Only before dinner,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.688
and not during dinner.

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:52.920
Do as your mom says.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.839
Okay.

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:55.799
(To stop you from going...)

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:57.720
(Sorry, Dad.)

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.240
What is this?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.960
We're going to the carnival tomorrow!

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.039
Awesome!

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:45.680
Say,

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.880
what's the rush?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.119
We leave tomorrow,

00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:49.480
and you're loading the luggage now?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.279
We leave early tomorrow.

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:53.039
Now, we can

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.279
get some extra winks in the morning.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.599
Honey,

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:03.079
look at this.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.400
This is...

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.160
Is this a flat tire?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.160
Yes.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.440
But all four tires are flat...

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:20.440
Someone must have done this on purpose.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.279
Let's call the police.

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:26.759
Forget it.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.039
It's not a big deal.

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:29.720
Let's call Huang

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:30.920
and have him fix the tires.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.319
Right now?

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.039
It's already late.

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:34.680
His workshop must be
closed for the day.

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:37.839
Besides, how do we go there
with four flat tires?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.559
How about

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:46.119
we cancel the trip

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.599
to Ninghai tomorrow?

00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:48.319
Yes.

00:19:48.359 --> 00:19:48.960
Don't go.

00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:49.960
No.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.240
I promised him.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.880
Bei has been wanting

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.440
to go to the Beach Carnival.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.720
He's been talking about it.

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:56.759
If we don't go,

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:58.319
I'd be breaking my promise.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.599
I don't want to disappoint Bei.

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.799
(So, it was me)

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.960
(who insisted on going
to the Beach Carnival.)

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.279
I'd hate to cancel too,

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:09.000
but it'll take time

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.079
to fix the car.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.799
Don't go.

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:16.079
We can take the bus instead.

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.160
There's the overnight bus

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.400
that departs in the wee hours

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.720
and arrives at Ninghai in the morning.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.960
We can take the bus.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.480
If we take the bus,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.640
if anything happens to my patients,

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.079
I might not make it back in time.

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:29.839
You're not the only doctor
in the hospital.

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:31.240
Someone else can take over.

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:32.519
Don't go.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.240
Don't go.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.720
Fine.

00:20:38.288 --> 00:20:39.240
I'll buy the tickets.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.079
That sounds more like it.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.279
I don't want

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.400
to leave any regrets in Bei's childhood.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.920
Later, we need to tuck Bei in bed early.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.559
(No.)

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.240
(Not even if they take the bus.)

00:20:49.599 --> 00:20:50.720
(I need to stop them.)

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.680
Hello,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.960
how many buses are there
to Ninghai today?

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.680
There's the last bus tonight.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.000
I'll buy up all the seats.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.839
Are you sure?

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.880
All 28 of them?

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:16.880
Yes.

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:18.000
Okay.

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:18.880
A moment, please.

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:21.200
2,800 yuan.

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:22.599
Here.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.666
Who's scanning, you or me?

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.440
What?

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:27.640
It's okay.

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.559
Anyway, I'll buy up all the tickets.

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.070
Let me take care of the money.

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:35.559
Sir.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:36.799
Sir.

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.000
Can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.839
I'll pay you back.

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:39.440
Sorry,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.279
I can't help you.

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:41.200
I have no money.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.319
Ask someone else.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.960
Hello, can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.480
No.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.880
Sir, can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:47.240
You must be mad.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.200
Borrowing money from me?

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.200
Kid,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.480
I've got my eye on you in there.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.200
Sir,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.480
can you lend me 2,800 yuan?

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:54.710
You're trying to cheat me now?

00:21:54.711 --> 00:21:55.310
Come with me.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:55.559
No.

00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:56.079
Come with me.

00:21:56.079 --> 00:21:57.039
I can explain.

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.510
You can explain at the police station.

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.839
Su Huabin! Dr. Su!

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.880
You're

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.000
calling me?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.039
You know me?

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.460
(Huayang Bus Terminal)

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.440
My grandfather

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.799
is your patient.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:15.440
He often told us

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.599
that you're a great doctor

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.839
because you

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.359
extended his life from a few months

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.559
to years since then.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.119
You are

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.160
Mr. Zhou's

00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:31.359
grandson?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.079
Yes.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.069
You two know each other?

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.244
Take him away from here.

00:22:38.244 --> 00:22:40.160
Don't let him borrow money
from random strangers.

00:22:40.177 --> 00:22:41.070
Sorry for the trouble.

00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:41.680
Not at all.

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:47.480
Is your grandfather doing fine?

00:22:49.519 --> 00:22:50.359
Pretty good.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.960
Earlier,

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:54.039
he was saying that you're

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.920
borrowing money?

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:57.920
My grandfather

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.759
is celebrating his 90th birthday soon,

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:02.759
and our whole family is about

00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:04.759
to go to Ninghai to visit him.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.400
We hired a driver and a car,

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.160
but they canceled us last minute.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.319
That's why I'm trying
to buy tickets here.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.880
There are 28 of us,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.119
so we need 28 tickets,

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:14.319
which cost 2,800 yuan.

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.279
But...

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:17.799
I forgot to bring money.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.039
Actually,

00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:22.559
our family is planning to take
this bus to Ninghai too.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.079
But it's okay.

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:25.559
I'll think of something else.

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:26.680
Mr. Zhou

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:28.240
is someone I respect very much.

00:23:29.319 --> 00:23:30.119
How about this?

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:31.440
I'll lend you

00:23:32.319 --> 00:23:33.160
2,800 yuan.

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:35.880
Really?

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.920
Follow me to the bank.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.440
I don't have that much cash with me.

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:52.079
2,800 yuan.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.880
Take it.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.400
Thank you, Dr. Su.

00:23:55.799 --> 00:23:56.960
I have your phone number,

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.920
so I'll return the money once I'm back.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.440
Sure.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.319
Be careful on the way back.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.599
I'm off.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.240
By the way,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.319
you guys

00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:08.920
are not going to Ninghai anymore?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.559
It's not an urgent trip.

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:12.799
We can always

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.279
go there next time.

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:15.880
Okay.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.440
Goodbye.

00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:17.160
Goodbye.

00:24:39.759 --> 00:24:40.559
Dad.

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:42.000
Here's your money.

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:44.319
No,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:45.960
it's not safe here.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.240
Scram!

00:24:51.466 --> 00:24:53.270
You're the one who sabotaged the tires.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.440
I knew I could catch you here.

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.039
I'm calling the police.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.319
Don't try to run away.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.160
Mr. Shen...

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.279
You don't have to explain.

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:02.720
When you slashed the tires,

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.400
I saw you from my house.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.480
Mr. Shen!

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:09.799
Wait.

00:25:10.319 --> 00:25:11.960
How do you know they call me Mr. Shen?

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.599
Mr. Shen, I know you.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.044
Doesn't my face look familiar?

00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:16.240
You remember now?

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.400
Oh, my.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.559
You've been secretly

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:21.880
gathering information on everyone here.

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:23.519
So, are you pulling off a heist?

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880
No.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.640
We know each other.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.680
I'm your neighbor.

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:27.839
Be honest,

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:28.720
or else I'll...

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.119
Mr. Shen!

00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:30.319
What's wrong?

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.920
Dr. Su!

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.960
Over here!

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:32.480
Mr. Shen,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.839
put the bottle down.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:35.720
Don't get worked up.
You might injure someone.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.319
Dr. Su,

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.960
I caught the culprit
who slashed your tires!

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:42.319
It's you?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.039
I'm not.

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:44.759
You're not?

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:45.599
I can bear witness!

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.300
♪What do you call your father's father?♪

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.860
♪Your father's father
is your grandfather♪

00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.319
It's iced.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.200
Thank you.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.420
♪What do you call your father's sister?♪

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.140
♪Your father's sister is your aunt♪

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:17.759
Did you slash the tires?

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:20.079
Yes.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.119
Dr. Su.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.720
Actually,

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:29.240
about the tickets,

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:30.920
I lied to you too.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.039
Here,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.759
it's your money.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.839
So,

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.599
you're not Mr. Zhou's grandson?

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:48.640
No.

00:26:49.319 --> 00:26:50.599
Then, who are you?

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.480
How did you

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.680
know me?

00:26:57.359 --> 00:26:58.200
I...

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.759
I'm not interrogating you.

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:06.240
If you refuse to say,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400
I won't ask.

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:09.640
I just want to tell you

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.720
that you're still young.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.200
You look like a decent lad.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.599
If you do well,

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.160
I believe you will be a great person.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.200
Actually,

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:23.480
I take after

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.839
my dad and mom.

00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:28.119
My father's

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:29.440
just like you.

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:31.400
He's a doctor.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.960
My fellow colleague?

00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:36.119
Which hospital does he work at?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.119
He's no longer around.

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:48.039
I'm sorry.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.319
It's okay.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.519
Daddy, why aren't you home yet?

00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:57.920
Bei.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.319
I'll be back soon.

00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:01.200
Tell me a bedtime story later.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.880
Sure.

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:02.720
I'll be back

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.559
to tell you a bedtime story.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.359
You promise?

00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:05.720
Yes.

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:06.839
I'll be back right away.

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:22.160
I need to go home now.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.440
Thank you.

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:27.559
Promise me.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.000
In the future,

00:28:29.559 --> 00:28:30.799
take every step wisely.

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:33.880
Promise me this.

00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:39.839
I promise.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.620
♪What do you call your father's father?♪

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.319
♪Your father's father
is your grandfather♪

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:53.960
Father.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:09.480
Your father's father

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.799
is your grandfather.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.119
That's a catchy nursery rhyme.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640
Can you

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:20.119
give me a coin

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.240
to ride that?

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:27.160
Say,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.880
a handsome lad like you

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.960
can be so erratic.

00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:34.880
Catch.

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:43.799
Bye.

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:45.160
See you.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.440
Stop!

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.359
Don't go!

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.079
Come back!

00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:18.319
I need to call him.

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:19.119
My phone.

00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:22.559
Why is there no signal?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.920
2005!

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.160
I know you.

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:29.559
You're Bei.

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:32.359
How did you grow up so fast?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.079
Mr. Shen, I have no time for this.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.933
My parents are going to die
in a car crash!

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.200
You can't go.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.559
Not until you explain.

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:39.599
What car crash?

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.799
Later, I'm in a rush.

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:42.000
It's still early.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.759
The buses,

00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:44.519
taxis and rickshaws
are not in service yet.

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:45.440
How will you go after them?

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.279
What should I do?

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:47.240
I have.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.960
Mr. Shen,

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.079
is this your car?

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:55.559
It's yours now.

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:58.000
Go.

00:30:58.119 --> 00:30:59.039
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.000
Run along now!

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:09.359
This kid grows up so fast.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.599
Su Beilu.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.100
(13 October 2005)

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.799
We must thank

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.039
Huang for this.

00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:38.440
He spent the night patching up the tires

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:40.680
so that Bei

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.880
could realize

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.839
his wish.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.680
It's all thanks to you, too.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.960
You performed surgery on his wife,

00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:48.319
so he was willing to help.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.559
I'm a doctor.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.880
Isn't that my job?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.400
Honey, there's a gas station in front.

00:32:55.422 --> 00:32:56.440
There's a store there too.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.480
Let's make a stop

00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:58.680
to buy some snacks for Bei.

00:32:59.039 --> 00:32:59.720
Sure.

00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:01.480
I'll go with you.

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:03.400
We left in a hurry,

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.644
so we forgot to pack water.

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:06.519
Yeah, sure.

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.039
Su Beilu.

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:37.599
I'm telling you,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.839
you guys must not go to Ninghai today.

00:33:40.119 --> 00:33:41.240
When your parents come back,

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400
just throw a tantrum.

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:43.519
A huge tantrum.

00:33:43.555 --> 00:33:44.777
Tell them you don't want to go,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.480
okay?

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.400
You're not a teacher!

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.319
I've never seen you in the kindergarten!

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.200
Dad!

00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:55.720
Mom!

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:57.119
- Mom!
- Bei!

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.000
What's wrong, Bei?

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:59.640
What's wrong, Bei? Why are you crying?

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:01.119
What happened, sweetheart?

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:02.960
There's a kidnapper.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.240
Kidnapper?

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.480
Where?

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:08.360
Honey,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.079
let's go.

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.320
I don't think it's safe here.

00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:25.800
Don't go!

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:45.451

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.120
=The Company=
=Season 1=

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:41.260
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.100
=Episode 7=

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.060
Aren't you supposed to be going
to the Liuyun Poetry Gathering?

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.710
Why are you signing here?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.150
Maybe I shouldn't go.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.550
Why not?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.190
Mr. Jiang Ling saved my life

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.430
and kindly invited me
without looking down on my low status.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.190
But I'm plain-looking,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.800
and I don't have a decent outfit.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.630
If I go there so rashly,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.750
won't I only embarrass him even more?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.360
That's not true.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.580
I won't allow you
to look down on yourself like that.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.590
The Liuyun Poetry Gathering

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.120
is the most splendid banquet

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.710
in the entire Lake Dongting.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.280
You should go take a look.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.080
But everyone attending
will be noble ladies,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.560
beauties, and famed courtesans.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.190
How could I compare to them?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.680
"Her face is seen in flower
and her dress in cloud."

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.750
Many beauties

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.280
in this world

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.560
are simply dressed up in fine clothes.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.920
Chan,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.030
look.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.280
So beautiful.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.120
Don't worry, Chan.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.840
Tonight,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.360
I'll make you the prettiest lady.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.430
Do I look good, Nuan?

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.750
Yes.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.070
Thank you, Nuan.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.750
Remember to come back early tonight.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
It's dangerous at night.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.720
Say, Nuan,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.920
the officer who bullied me
the other night is dead.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.190
Right by that small road
where you came to pick me up.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.240
If he bullied you,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.070
then he was a bad man.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.680
Such people

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.120
deserve to die.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.310
Chan,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.360
you wouldn't know

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.390
how many wicked things
that officers did before

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.480
to meet such retribution.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.000
Anyway,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.270
bad people

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.830
will be punished by Heaven.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.720
Since

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.560
he's paid his dues,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.510
you should feel at ease now.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.680
Besides,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.310
both Heaven and I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.240
are watching over you.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.630
I'll always protect you.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.140
(Blossom Parlor)

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.680
This place is much prettier
than Zuichun House.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360
Look at this calligraphy.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.480
The brushwork is so smooth.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.600
May I ask

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.120
where Mr. Jiang Ling is?

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.190
You can look for him inside.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.630
This...

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.430
Please come in, Miss.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.750
A mere servant dares
to think so highly of yourself?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.990
I provide you with food, clothes,
and shelter.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.160
Instead of earning money
for me in return,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.870
you start dreaming of freedom?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.950
Sir,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.000
it's all my fault.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.300
It has nothing to do with Yanyan.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.390
I beg you.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.270
Please be merciful

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.310
and let Yanyan go.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.270
- I'll serve you my whole life.
- Yanyan.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.630
Whole life?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.270
You say that so easily?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.560
But

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.120
do you have more time left?

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.160
No. Please spare me, sir.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.120
It's all my fault.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.480
I was being foolish.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.070
Mr. Chen knows nothing at all.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.190
I'm willing to return to Zuichun House

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.510
to serve you the rest of my life

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.750
until I die.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.240
Sir, please.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.720
Please spare him.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.270
Yanyan.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720
Do you remember?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.360
Your name was given by me.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.920
I rescued you from the slaughterhouse.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.510
You eat and drink well in Zuichun House.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.510
Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.750
You are raised fair and clean.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.120
And now you speak of love?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.750
I've been alone since childhood.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.920
If I die, no one will remember me.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.120
But Mr. Chen has an elderly mother
and young siblings.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.800
Mr. Jiang,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.040
heaven cherishes life,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.830
and humans have compassion.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.720
Mr. Jiang.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.270
I'm begging you.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.600
Please spare Mr. Chen.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.310
I'll give you a chance.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.680
Kill him.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.400
No.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.030
Kill him,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.360
and I'll spare you.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.000
Afraid?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.320
I'll teach you.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.670
Mr. Jiang.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.560
Yanyan.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.000
Kill me.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.480
Don't worry.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.280
It'll be quick.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.390
No.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.080
Like this.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.000
Just kill me.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.320
Yanyan!

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.990
Yanyan!

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.060
Chop off her hand.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.910
No.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.750
Let go of her.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.560
Yanyan!

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.440
- Who's there?
- Yanyan!

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.630
Go take a look.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.510
Over there.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.080
Mr. Jiang, someone jumped
into the water.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.090
We didn't see their face.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.990
- Chan.
- Nuan.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.920
What happened?

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.000
Come, sit down.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.960
Nuan.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.000
Nuan, I...

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360
Chan.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.600
Take it. Share it with others.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.320
Your hairpin doesn't look good.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.440
You should fix it.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.270
Have you heard?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.390
Last time it was an officer.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.440
Just three days later,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.750
they found a severed hand
by the lake again.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.630
Severed hand?

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.470
Yes.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.340
Whose hand?

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.550
Linglong went to identify it.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.360
She said the bracelet on it

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.630
belonged to Yanyan.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.720
It must be hers.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.670
Yanyan really had a hard life.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.000
I heard

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.510
that man was cruel.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.190
He tricked her with a promise
to elope with her.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.200
But in fact, he took all her savings

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.840
and then killed her.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.670
Poor Yanyan.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.750
I thought she had
finally escaped her misery.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.550
Why are you all chatting here?

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.870
Go entertain guests now.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.960
Chan,

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.440
someone's looking for you.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.720
A young master.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.870
He's at the entrance.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.600
Young master?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.840
Who is he?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.960
Who cares
what kind of young master he is?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.000
Hurry up and move now.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.720
Quick.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.550
Last night at the pleasure boat banquet,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.600
I didn't see you, Miss Chan.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.040
I thought

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.200
you might be willing to attend.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.630
Last night...

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.030
Last night, I wasn't feeling well,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.550
so I couldn't make it.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.550
I failed your kind invitation.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.240
I see.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.510
Your health is more important.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.320
I'm much better now.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.440
There's somewhere I need to be.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.360
Do you recognize this?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.600
The gift I gave you.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.240
Keep it safe.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.720
Since we missed each other last night,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.270
why not visit

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.790
my residence today?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.110
No.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.840
I noticed your pale complexion

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.270
and planned to ask my physician

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.390
to read your pulse
and prescribe some medicine.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.960
You're weak.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.080
Don't let a small illness

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.840
cost your life.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.510
That would truly be

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.000
a shame.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.270
Most lamentable.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.230
Mr. Jiang.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.840
Mr. Jiang, you came at the right time.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.510
I was about to report

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.600
last month's accounts to you.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.480
Why isn't she out yet?

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.030
Did we miss her again?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.550
- Over here.
- This way, please.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.870
Gentlemen,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.390
I'm sorry.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.270
I saw her just a moment ago,

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.720
but when I stepped away,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.150
the other girls said

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.960
she had left.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.870
Again?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.320
Very well.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.390
Another wasted trip.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.390
Where can we find her now?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.440
Gentlemen,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.790
why are you looking for her?

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.600
We're trying to get that candle back.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.320
You've looked for her several times

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.550
for that candle.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.550
You both seem like decent people.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.630
Please don't trouble her.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.600
Don't misunderstand.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.080
We won't trouble her.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.510
On the contrary, that candle
will bring her danger.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.870
Really?

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.030
Yes.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.440
We're trying to help her.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.840
Could you tell us where she lives?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.030
She lives

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.510
by the western lotus pond,

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.150
beside the crooked-neck willow tree.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.750
Thank you.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.080
You must help her, gentlemen.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.920
Please.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.900
(Zuichun House)

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.240
Nuan, we should pack our things
and leave this place now.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.550
What are you doing?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.080
I'm making some preparations.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.080
These flowers are highly poisonous.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.240
I know.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.360
In times like this,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.240
everyone keeps something
for self-defense.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.960
For self-defense?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.000
Yes.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.070
I can only feel at ease

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.480
if I keep you safe.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.680
Keep me safe?

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.480
Then just protect me.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.510
Why must you harm others?

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.880
Are you planning to poison
Mr. Jiang Ling?

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.630
Give it to me.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.280
What else can we do then?

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.160
If you don't kill him,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.880
he'll kill you.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.070
I'm doing this for your own good.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.030
We can go somewhere else

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.510
and start over.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.510
Where?

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.720
I'm just a mermaid of Dongting.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.110
You're just an orphan.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.680
But this world

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.070
is full of sanctimonious people

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.200
like Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.160
To deal with the likes of them,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.920
you must tear off their masks

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.440
and strike first.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.920
Besides,

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.070
he deceived you.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.880
Poisoning him

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.350
is already merciful.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.440
Nuan,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.030
how did you become so cruel?

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.070
Cruel?

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.350
You say

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.310
I'm cruel?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.960
Isn't killing cruel?

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.240
I don't want you to do that.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.640
Where's the gentle Nuan from before?

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.960
I don't want you to be like this.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.920
People say the lotus

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.440
remains pure despite the mud.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.350
But

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.790
without mud,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.960
there would be no lotus.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.830
Where do you think
everything you eat, wear, and use

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.400
comes from?

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.590
When we first met,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.750
that steamed bun I gave you

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.880
was meant for you.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.880
The pears.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.880
I stole them.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.510
Hurry and eat it. It's very sweet.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.640
The hairpin.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.790
I stole it from the night market.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.830
This one

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.240
suits you very well.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.550
I think you could try the green one.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.400
Right?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.100
That outfit really
brings out your looks.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.880
And the chicken for stew,

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.750
I stole that too.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.830
I only wanted you

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.030
to eat something good once in a while.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.790
But it's never that easy.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.920
And the beautiful clothes you wore
to meet Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.310
I stole that too.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.720
Chan,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.310
everything I did

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.550
was for your own good.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.870
What about

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.030
the officer?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.400
The one who died by the river.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.920
That beast

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.880
tried to harass you.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.440
He should've died long ago.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.200
- Chan.
- Don't come near me.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.920
Chan.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.480
- Chan.
- Don't come near me!

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.240
Why?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.520
Chan.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.200
Why are you afraid of me?

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.550
In this world,

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.590
the one who treats you best

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.030
is only me.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.630
Chan.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.800
Careful!

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.550
Help!

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.640
Help!

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.480
- Nuan.
- Help!

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.030
Nuan.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.550
We can't get out.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.240
Nuan.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.590
I will get you out.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.000
Nuan, we can't get out anymore.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.440
Nuan,

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.880
we really can't get out of here.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.630
Are you hurt?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.560
No.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.880
Why are you always so reckless?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.480
She said there was someone inside.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.070
Of course, I had to check.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.550
What if you couldn't get out?

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.480
I have you.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:10.950
Me? Then...

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.880
Then,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.640
what if I can't get out either?

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.920
You'd still find a way.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.240
Nuan.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.790
Thank goodness you're all right.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.280
She's awake.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.590
Thank you for saving me.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.270
Please don't do that.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.830
I think no one saw us rescue you.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.610
This way leads straight to the dock.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.070
We prepared a boat for you.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.400
You should leave now.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.880
Thank you, sir.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.880
If fate allows,

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.750
I'll repay you someday.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.150
Wait, Miss.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.880
The candle in your hand

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.590
belonged to a friend of mine.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.240
May I have it back?

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:31.670
Nuan,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.030
wait for me at the door.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.800
Sir,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.590
this candle is very important to me.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.750
It's been with me for many years.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.190
Besides,

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.030
it's not just a candle.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160
It's Nuan.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.000
Nuan has always stayed with me.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.960
I can't give it to you.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.480
This candle can't turn into a person.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.590
Your Nuan

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.680
is nothing but a hope you imagined

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.200
when you had your hardest time.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.440
Now that things have come to this,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.110
it's time to wake up.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.510
What are you talking about?

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.240
Imagine?

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.510
Nuan is right there.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.030
You're the ones
who saved her from the fire.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.550
Just now,

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.590
when I rushed into the place,

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.560
there was

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.200
no one inside.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.510
What are you on about?

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.640
Nuan is right...

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.440
There's no one here

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.680
but you.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.350
Nuan doesn't exist at all.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.440
Wake up, Miss.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.440
Give it back to me.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.070
Nuan.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.830
Chan,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.750
life

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.270
is between you and me.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.680
Nuan.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.310
You could've started a new life
on your own.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.960
You just couldn't let go of
the suffering and regret of the past.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.090
Beyond this door is a new beginning.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.370
Are you willing to try?

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.390
Is it really all right

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.960
to let her leave alone

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.230
like this?

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.590
I'm not sure either.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.510
But she has to find her own path.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.230
We can't help her forever.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.470
That's true.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.280
At least she survived.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.440
What does this candle remind you of?

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.420
(Caiwei, maidservant)

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.720
How does it taste?

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.230
The brew is good,

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.190
and the cups are fine too.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.290
You couldn't sleep at night.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.190
What's troubling you, Ziyi?

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.760
I've always disliked power,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.400
yet trouble came to me.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.070
I'm mired in it.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.440
Why can't they understand?

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.630
For people who chase

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.800
fame and profit,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.480
what they really crave is

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.360
a prison I wish to avoid.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.030
All I ever want

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.760
is freedom.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.280
I have no ambition.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.150
I only wish to push a few reforms,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.190
but every step is hard.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.590
Fine brew alone won't do tonight.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.920
Would you come somewhere with me?

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:58.950
Sure.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.630
Then, I'll trouble Miss Caiwei

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.800
to wait outside.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.120
Yes.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.510
Please.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.480
This view exists only in dreams.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.000
Five-colored light
piercing the Ziwei stars.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.550
This must be it.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.070
With such beauty,

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.000
will you let go of your worries,
my friend?

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.590
The universe is vast.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.360
All beings are free.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.840
I feel more and more

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.670
that I'm but a mayfly
between heaven and earth,

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.760
trapped in a mundane world.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.670
Forgive me.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.630
I was rambling.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.920
It doesn't make any sense.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.120
It's fine.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.070
Compared to the boundless skies,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.510
a human life

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.800
passes in a blink.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.440
You should seize the present

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880
and fulfill your aims,

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.880
so as not to leave regrets.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.960
Bizhi.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.480
Who are you, really?

00:38:26.543 --> 00:38:27.550
Your friend.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.550
Looks like

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.070
Heaven has been kind

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.320
to me.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.630
Having a friend like you

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.710
is a great gift in my life.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.230
The honor is mine.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.920
Coming to see you tonight

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.590
was the right choice.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.390
The road of the human world is long.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.590
The journey is worth it.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.150
The journey is worth it.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.670
Caiwei.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.760
Something's happened to Mr. Qin.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.800
May I speak with you?

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.480
Come on in.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.230
What is it?

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.940
The sudden death
of the Second Young Master

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.800
has been pinned on Mr. Qin.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.710
In truth, it's because his reforms

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.000
affected family interests.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.800
After returning home yesterday,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.320
he was confined.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.030
He sends me to tell you this.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.710
"My innocence will define me
in the end, so don't worry."

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.980
How long will the confinement last?

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.670
They're seeking witnesses.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:53.710
If none are found,

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.360
they'll look for physical evidence.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.110
Mr. Qin says

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.880
it's only a matter of a few days.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.670
Please wait.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.480
Witness and evidence?

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.360
I can look for them for Ziyi.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:10.230
Mr. Qin says,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.360
unless it's absolutely necessary,

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.880
you need not act.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.550
I take my leave.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.910
Wait.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.230
You dropped a candle here last night.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.240
Thank you.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.030
Please keep me informed of

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.030
Ziyi's situation.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.350
Yes.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.000
At that time,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.710
I had a sense of unease in my heart.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.000
I never thought

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.440
that night would be the last I saw Ziyi.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.030
I see.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.030
There's one more thing we need to do.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.280
What is it?

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.550
To make them believe

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.230
Chan is dead.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.580
(Yashe)

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:16.840
Sorry.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.510
It got burned.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.710
It can't be used anymore.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.160
It's fine.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.480
But using sheep bones in the fire

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.110
to pass them off

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.800
as Chan's remains

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:30.960
was clever.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.880
That way, no one will trouble her again.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.110
When you wouldn't
let me warn Li Yansheng,

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.710
I thought you were cold-hearted.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.590
Turns out you're actually quite kind.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.400
I didn't do anything.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.230
It's just that Chan wasn't meant to die.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.230
How's your injury?

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.190
I have this.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.510
It can help heal wounds.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.480
Is this

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.070
a nanobot?

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.320
Something like that.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.000
And your injury?

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.320
I'm fine. Just got scorched by the fire.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.280
Some ointment will do.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.750
You're always pushing yourself
like this.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.670
What if something really happens?

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.590
You can make me another one of those

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.400
nanobot suits of yours.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:21.420
(Attended)

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.140
(Yashe)

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.630
Bye-bye.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.310
Remember to come find me again
next time.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.710
(This can't go on.)

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.960
(If he isn't Mr. Qin,)

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.230
(I shouldn't keep bringing him along
through time travel.)

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.180
(Away)

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.440
(Yashe)

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.960
(If danger arises,)

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.760
(history will repeat itself.)

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.860
(Days pass, months move on)

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.460
(Gentle as Breeze)

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.780
(Year 2021)

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.440
(2021?)

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.400

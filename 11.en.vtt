00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:06.923
[The child actors were filmed safely.]

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.723
[The animal scenes were staged,
in compliance with animal welfare guidelines.]

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:14.483
Shield!

00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:38.013
This is...

00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:24.053
[Episode 11: A dream or the end?]

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:43.683
My Lady, are you waking up?

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:45.073
Yeah.

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:48.343
My Lady, hold me.

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:53.113
Are you okay?

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.403
Prince Gyeongseong is not even here.

00:02:56.403 --> 00:03:00.383
I am worried you faint so often.

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:03.503
Do I need to get you some herbal medicine?

00:03:12.883 --> 00:03:17.273
<i>It's the same figurine I bought near school.</i>

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:21.473
<i>How is it here?</i>

00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:23.313
<i>Is it a coincidence?</i>

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:25.113
By the way, Bang Wool,

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:26.753
where did this figurine come from?

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:29.473
Did you forget already?

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:32.133
This is that stuff.

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:44.503
Life is stuffy and boring?

00:03:44.503 --> 00:03:48.563
It is like someone designed
my daily life. It feels stuffy.

00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:53.423
Maybe something new could change things up.

00:03:56.073 --> 00:03:59.443
This sounds like a rich girl is whining, right?

00:04:00.753 --> 00:04:02.593
Of course not.

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:07.853
I, Seol Gi, have many solutions
to address your concern.

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:17.363
Pick one you are drawn to out of these.

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:21.773
That will be the solution to your concern.

00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:38.163
<i>By chance,</i>

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:41.843
<i>did this figurine lead me here?</i>

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:44.453
I think I need to go there.

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:46.923
Would you be okay?

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:55.063
Where did she go?

00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:58.053
Let me check if she is nearby.

00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:16.843
My Lady, are you okay?

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:18.373
Oh, my.

00:05:18.373 --> 00:05:20.523
Well, yes.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:23.503
I have not seen that figurine in a while.

00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:25.443
Did it work at all?

00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:29.163
What effect does this have, exactly?

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:37.133
Since you visited me to escape
mundane everyday life,

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:38.853
your solution would be...

00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:42.853
the beginning of a new life.

00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:45.303
The beginning of a new life?

00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:49.283
But your lover is a bigger issue.

00:05:53.773 --> 00:05:56.363
I heard he was sent to a battle.
You must be worried.

00:05:56.363 --> 00:05:59.053
Yes, I'm so worried.

00:05:59.053 --> 00:06:00.993
Let us see. Let us see.

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:05.553
Will her lover return safely?

00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:19.993
I cannot get an answer to the question.

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:23.213
I am getting a strange reading instead.

00:06:23.213 --> 00:06:26.433
Strange reading? Like what...

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:29.503
The ending.

00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:34.723
Everything concludes when you reach the ending.

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:36.943
What does that mean?

00:06:36.943 --> 00:06:39.453
I am not so sure, either.

00:06:39.453 --> 00:06:42.243
I have never gotten a reading like this.

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:51.433
<i>Everything concludes when you reach the ending.</i>

00:06:52.353 --> 00:06:54.883
By "concludes,"

00:06:57.713 --> 00:07:01.113
does it mean this world will disappear?

00:07:16.823 --> 00:07:19.023
Wake up.

00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:23.873
Only focus on Prince Gyeongseong's
safe return for now.

00:07:25.843 --> 00:07:29.043
The ending has not been determined yet.

00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:33.693
I need to be stronger at times like this.

00:07:40.403 --> 00:07:41.893
So,

00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:45.823
did Prince Gyeongseong leave for the border?

00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:47.873
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:47.873 --> 00:07:50.473
You made a very wise decision.

00:07:50.473 --> 00:07:53.713
I am sure he could defeat the barbarians

00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:55.903
and return with the Emperor's edict.

00:07:55.903 --> 00:08:00.573
This is all thanks to your resourcefulness.

00:08:00.573 --> 00:08:02.433
You are too generous.

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:06.643
You made this decision on your own.

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.713
By the way,

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:20.783
what would happen if Prince Gyeongseong
cannot make it back alive?

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:23.923
Do you not have faith in him?

00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:26.233
If he is absent around here for too long,

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:28.143
who...

00:08:28.143 --> 00:08:30.593
who would protect me?

00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:37.283
Heuksa Clan.

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:40.283
The Heuksa Clan will come for my head.

00:08:40.283 --> 00:08:42.553
Heuksa Clan... H-Heuksa Clan...

00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:44.823
H-Heuksa Clan... Heuksa...

00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:46.753
My head...

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:48.423
Heuksa Clan... Heuksa Clan...

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:50.173
Your Majesty.

00:08:52.883 --> 00:08:54.503
Your Majesty...

00:08:58.323 --> 00:09:00.883
Why are you worried about that?

00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:05.313
You now have me by your side, Your Majesty.

00:09:10.193 --> 00:09:11.883
That is right.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:18.503
I have you, Prince Seonghyeon.

00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:21.833
I had Prince Seonghyeon.

00:09:26.883 --> 00:09:31.873
The incense you brought from China

00:09:31.873 --> 00:09:34.413
is relaxing me.

00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:38.643
I finally had a good sleep.

00:09:38.643 --> 00:09:41.273
That is a relief, Your Majesty.

00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:46.833
Continue to keep this incense by his bed.

00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:48.283
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:09:59.423 --> 00:10:02.253
Gosh, I am cold and hungry.

00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:04.533
What do I do?

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:09.173
How will I enter the house?

00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:14.743
I cannot hide you anymore.

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:17.633
If you get caught, both of us will die.

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:19.993
What if we get caught by Lady Eun Ae?

00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:22.433
That is why you should not do something so risky.

00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:25.683
I wanted to escape the slave life.

00:10:27.213 --> 00:10:28.353
Gosh, My Lady.

00:10:28.353 --> 00:10:31.293
What are you doing here right now?

00:10:53.013 --> 00:10:54.813
<i>Prince Gyeongseong,</i>

00:10:54.813 --> 00:10:57.353
<i>although we are apart,</i>

00:10:57.353 --> 00:11:01.593
<i>I can sense you in this place.</i>

00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:11.153
<i>Cha Sun Chaek.</i>

00:11:27.223 --> 00:11:28.623
Here.

00:11:31.953 --> 00:11:33.643
So pretty.

00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:18.443
You care for small things like this.

00:12:18.443 --> 00:12:20.933
You really are a madam now.

00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:23.703
I want to care for every little thing

00:12:23.703 --> 00:12:26.983
in Hoseondang without missing anything.

00:12:32.203 --> 00:12:34.013
Let us go that way, Maiden.

00:12:34.013 --> 00:12:36.133
Shall we, Young Master?

00:12:44.153 --> 00:12:46.593
<i>So pretty.</i>

00:12:58.983 --> 00:13:00.063
You're...

00:13:00.063 --> 00:13:02.633
There you were, my boy.

00:13:04.933 --> 00:13:06.453
Aigoo...

00:13:07.163 --> 00:13:11.433
He seems happier to see you
than to see me, Sun Chaek.

00:13:13.983 --> 00:13:17.853
You seem to have changed a lot
since I last saw you.

00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:23.673
I hope you stop calling me
by my name from now on.

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:27.783
I am now Hoseondang's madam.

00:13:30.813 --> 00:13:32.923
I see.

00:13:34.943 --> 00:13:38.753
But I thought you were the kind
of person who'd never get

00:13:38.753 --> 00:13:41.453
involved with Prince Gyeongseong

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:44.123
let alone marry him.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.723
Why did you think that?

00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:50.773
Someone endlessly sweet,

00:13:50.773 --> 00:13:52.823
kind...

00:13:52.823 --> 00:13:56.793
and knows how you feel without being told.

00:13:56.793 --> 00:13:59.103
That was the husband material you wanted.

00:13:59.103 --> 00:14:03.063
If so, that's the reason why.

00:14:03.063 --> 00:14:07.673
I've never met anyone like
Prince Gyeongseong, who's so sweet, kind,

00:14:07.673 --> 00:14:12.803
and understands my feelings
even when I'm not aware of them.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:30.333
<i>What brings you here?</i>

00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:31.843
<i>My Lady is out at the moment.</i>

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:33.613
<i>Give me a break.</i>

00:14:39.043 --> 00:14:41.283
I knew it.

00:14:41.283 --> 00:14:43.633
So, you were here.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:47.433
Is lying your and your servant's
specialty around here?

00:14:48.633 --> 00:14:50.193
You laugh?

00:14:52.603 --> 00:14:54.513
Should I cry, then?

00:14:54.513 --> 00:14:56.753
No, save it.

00:14:56.753 --> 00:14:59.453
Crying now would not be fun.

00:15:11.013 --> 00:15:12.833
What a scaredy-cat.

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.793
You are no match for me.

00:15:14.793 --> 00:15:16.283
Just cut to the chase.

00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:18.933
I will, then.

00:15:18.933 --> 00:15:20.923
You are dead now.

00:15:20.923 --> 00:15:23.043
I reported you to the Royal Investigation Bureau.

00:15:23.043 --> 00:15:26.253
I even secured witnesses.

00:15:26.253 --> 00:15:27.893
Wow.

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:32.803
I am so...

00:15:32.803 --> 00:15:35.073
scared.

00:15:37.543 --> 00:15:39.613
Do you have some kind of insurance?

00:15:39.613 --> 00:15:42.223
I am sick of being surprised, flustered,

00:15:42.223 --> 00:15:44.493
and crying.

00:15:44.493 --> 00:15:49.003
Let us see if you would be so confident
at the Royal Investigation Bureau, too.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:55.303
But I am not sure if you
would be able to see that.

00:15:56.833 --> 00:15:57.893
What do you mean?

00:15:57.893 --> 00:16:02.133
You drank this tea in one gulp
without knowing what was in it.

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:09.223
A-Are you saying there is
poison in it or something?

00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:13.993
I was kidding.

00:16:13.993 --> 00:16:16.903
Do not be such a scaredy-cat, My Lady.

00:16:49.823 --> 00:16:54.953
I think it is time to witness the perfect ending.

00:16:55.933 --> 00:16:58.333
My Lord.

00:17:02.213 --> 00:17:04.223
Aigoo...

00:17:05.103 --> 00:17:07.553
My Lord.

00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:14.033
You're here...

00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:17.623
Madam...

00:17:17.623 --> 00:17:19.633
W-What is going on?

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:21.503
Well...

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:46.563
Prince Gyeongseong got ambushed by the enemy

00:17:46.563 --> 00:17:48.763
and died at the scene.

00:17:52.903 --> 00:17:54.663
You're lying.

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:02.243
If he's actually dead,

00:18:02.243 --> 00:18:04.183
where's his body?

00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:07.453
They could not find the body.

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.633
See?

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:12.163
He's not dead, then.

00:18:12.163 --> 00:18:16.243
The barbarians take the body
of the enemy commander

00:18:17.273 --> 00:18:20.103
and display his head in public.

00:18:20.103 --> 00:18:23.753
<i>My Lord...</i>

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:27.783
You didn't check yourself.

00:18:29.723 --> 00:18:33.053
Prince Gyeongseong wouldn't
die so easily like this.

00:18:34.743 --> 00:18:37.233
So, everyone,

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.763
don't be sad.

00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:40.753
My Lord...

00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:44.803
We will hear that he's alive
when the sun comes up.

00:18:46.173 --> 00:18:48.313
I'm sure of it.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:05.053
No.

00:19:05.823 --> 00:19:07.563
No.

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.843
Prince Gyeongseong isn't just anyone.

00:19:15.673 --> 00:19:19.603
The male lead doesn't die.

00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:22.693
He doesn't die.

00:19:26.013 --> 00:19:28.683
I need to see it for myself.

00:19:59.853 --> 00:20:03.373
<i>Dear my lover, Cha Sun Chaek.</i>

00:20:05.643 --> 00:20:11.253
<i>This is the first time in my life
that I am writing a letter to someone.</i>

00:20:13.373 --> 00:20:17.793
<i>This is another first experience you gifted me.</i>

00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:21.463
<i>So, let me confess for the first time.</i>

00:20:21.463 --> 00:20:25.943
<i>To be honest, whenever I picked up a sword</i>

00:20:25.943 --> 00:20:28.713
<i>or entered a battle,</i>

00:20:28.713 --> 00:20:31.203
<i>I always felt afraid.</i>

00:20:37.963 --> 00:20:40.543
<i>But at the moment,</i>

00:20:40.543 --> 00:20:43.383
<i>rather than being afraid that I might die,</i>

00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:48.393
<i>I am more afraid that I am leaving my lover</i>

00:20:48.393 --> 00:20:50.403
<i>behind alone.</i>

00:21:24.153 --> 00:21:28.833
<i>All the victories in the battles
thus far were due to luck.</i>

00:23:12.033 --> 00:23:13.853
Prince Gyeongseong.

00:23:13.853 --> 00:23:16.373
You are done for now.

00:23:54.713 --> 00:23:58.683
You are the bastard Yi Gyu had mentioned.

00:24:29.673 --> 00:24:33.433
<i>You said you would bring me good luck,</i>

00:24:34.433 --> 00:24:37.293
<i>but the fact that I survived countless battles</i>

00:24:37.293 --> 00:24:40.643
<i>and slaughter alone is already a miracle.</i>

00:24:41.583 --> 00:24:44.633
<i>I dedicate this miracle to my lover,</i>

00:24:45.673 --> 00:24:47.713
<i>Cha Sun Chaek...</i>

00:24:52.273 --> 00:24:54.333
<i>who is reading this letter.</i>

00:25:28.613 --> 00:25:31.203
Let me ask you a favor.

00:25:32.453 --> 00:25:35.453
Just in case something happens to me...

00:25:35.453 --> 00:25:37.303
What are you talking about?

00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:39.643
I said, just in case.

00:25:40.643 --> 00:25:43.823
If something were to happen to me,

00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:49.873
please protect my lover.

00:25:49.873 --> 00:25:51.743
This is...

00:25:51.743 --> 00:25:56.463
my first and last favor I ask you as a friend.

00:25:57.973 --> 00:25:59.583
Beon...

00:26:12.715 --> 00:26:15.095
Please step outside for a moment.

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:42.575
Is this Prince Gyeongseong?

00:26:42.575 --> 00:26:44.335
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:26:44.335 --> 00:26:47.255
died on the battlefield, Your Majesty.

00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:02.705
Prince Gyeongseong died?

00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:06.085
How could the mighty Prince Gyeongseong...

00:27:06.085 --> 00:27:09.265
Dying for you on the battlefield

00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:12.335
must be his fate.

00:27:12.335 --> 00:27:14.495
Prince Gyeongseong...

00:27:16.595 --> 00:27:19.095
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

00:27:24.135 --> 00:27:29.415
I am not as healthy as I once was.

00:27:30.645 --> 00:27:32.885
Perhaps you should put your duties aside

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:35.755
and focus on getting your health back.

00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:38.845
I do not even have a crown prince.

00:27:38.845 --> 00:27:41.835
Who would I put in charge of my duties?

00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:46.335
You could also abdicate the throne.

00:27:48.505 --> 00:27:49.965
Abdicate?

00:27:49.965 --> 00:27:52.365
You never know what will happen.

00:27:52.365 --> 00:27:55.205
You worked so hard to build this country.

00:27:55.205 --> 00:27:58.115
Do you want it to falter?

00:27:58.115 --> 00:28:01.445
What if the remnants of the
Heuksa Clan take advantage

00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:05.045
of your poor health and choose the new king

00:28:05.045 --> 00:28:07.635
and flip this world upside down?

00:28:07.635 --> 00:28:09.905
No, no!

00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:11.805
That cannot happen.

00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:18.945
So, who should I abdicate the throne to?

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:35.865
Sun Chaek.

00:28:38.015 --> 00:28:40.305
What brings you here at this hour?

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:42.475
I heard about Prince Gyeongseong.

00:28:42.475 --> 00:28:44.605
Are you very shocked?

00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:48.935
I find it to be a pity, too.

00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:52.495
Who would have thought he
would die in a foreign land?

00:28:52.495 --> 00:28:54.535
Prince Gyeongseong is not dead.

00:28:54.535 --> 00:28:56.255
Do you really think so?

00:28:56.255 --> 00:29:01.045
I will convince His Majesty
to send reinforcements.

00:29:02.045 --> 00:29:07.965
His Majesty already knows no generals
came back alive from there

00:29:07.965 --> 00:29:10.345
better than anyone.

00:29:11.345 --> 00:29:13.965
Unless I advise him to do so,

00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:17.025
it would be difficult to...

00:29:18.965 --> 00:29:20.935
send reinforcements.

00:29:25.995 --> 00:29:27.965
- You cannot go.
- I need to go.

00:29:27.965 --> 00:29:29.275
I need to save Prince Gyeongseong.

00:29:29.275 --> 00:29:31.715
They said he is dead.

00:29:31.715 --> 00:29:33.435
If so,

00:29:33.435 --> 00:29:36.725
I will bring his body so he does not feel lonely.

00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:39.725
Will you really betray your family?

00:29:40.935 --> 00:29:42.755
From now on,

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:46.335
do not consider me as your child.

00:29:46.335 --> 00:29:48.095
Have you not come to your senses yet?

00:29:48.095 --> 00:29:51.325
No. I will not come to my senses.

00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:55.805
I am never good enough for you,
no matter what I do, anyway.

00:30:04.495 --> 00:30:06.735
If you go out that door,

00:30:08.105 --> 00:30:10.465
I could slay you.

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:19.985
I have no idea what kind of new world

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:23.725
you desire,

00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:28.805
but if my mother were alive,

00:30:31.015 --> 00:30:33.975
she would have trusted my decision.

00:30:48.415 --> 00:30:51.485
I do not want to live with guilt
for the rest of my life

00:30:51.485 --> 00:30:54.075
because of your mysterious cause.

00:30:54.075 --> 00:30:55.725
I would have to live in shame.

00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:57.695
You bastard!

00:30:57.695 --> 00:31:00.555
Do you even know what you are saying right now?

00:31:00.555 --> 00:31:02.835
I do not. But...

00:31:04.205 --> 00:31:06.255
I will manage my life...

00:31:07.645 --> 00:31:09.975
from now on.

00:31:16.955 --> 00:31:20.605
Can you make a request
to His Majesty on my behalf?

00:31:24.845 --> 00:31:27.005
I beg you.

00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:29.475
If you do me a favor,

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:33.995
I might be able to.

00:31:33.995 --> 00:31:36.415
What kind of favor is it?

00:31:36.415 --> 00:31:38.515
Please marry me.

00:31:39.795 --> 00:31:41.995
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:31:41.995 --> 00:31:45.305
You said you would do anything
to save Prince Gyeongseong.

00:31:45.305 --> 00:31:46.985
I already belong to Prince Gyeongseong.

00:31:46.985 --> 00:31:50.575
- I know.
- Why are you doing this to me, then?

00:31:52.055 --> 00:31:55.485
Because you always belonged to me.

00:31:55.485 --> 00:31:57.385
To be exact,

00:31:57.385 --> 00:32:00.835
Prince Gyeongseong stole you from me.

00:32:01.995 --> 00:32:05.525
I never belonged to you.

00:32:05.525 --> 00:32:09.035
You will from now on, then.

00:32:09.035 --> 00:32:12.695
Prince Gyeongseong will not make it back alive.

00:32:12.695 --> 00:32:16.445
Because I made sure of that.

00:32:16.445 --> 00:32:18.605
You're crazy.

00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:20.575
Why are you doing this to him?

00:32:20.575 --> 00:32:22.325
You already know.

00:32:22.325 --> 00:32:24.835
He stole what's precious to me.

00:32:24.835 --> 00:32:26.935
He had no choice, either.

00:32:26.935 --> 00:32:30.935
He was forced to make that
decision to survive as a child.

00:32:30.935 --> 00:32:32.785
He was tormented to see you again.

00:32:32.785 --> 00:32:35.085
What about my anger and pain?

00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:38.695
Do you not see them, Sun Chaek?

00:32:38.695 --> 00:32:40.025
Let go.

00:32:40.025 --> 00:32:42.025
I will soon achieve my goal.

00:32:42.025 --> 00:32:45.275
I can make you happy. You just...

00:32:45.275 --> 00:32:47.885
You just need to accept me.

00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:56.005
You were...

00:32:57.465 --> 00:33:00.265
You were in the Heuksa Clan.

00:33:04.205 --> 00:33:06.275
You caught on.

00:33:08.345 --> 00:33:10.105
You noticed so quickly.

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:12.795
Were you the one who's been
torturing Prince Gyeongseong?

00:33:12.795 --> 00:33:15.715
- Bringing him up again!
- Listen even if you don't want to.

00:33:15.715 --> 00:33:18.005
Prince Gyeongseong is my husband

00:33:18.005 --> 00:33:21.415
and I will never marry you even if it kills me.

00:33:33.995 --> 00:33:36.205
Sun Chaek, how could you do this to me?

00:33:36.205 --> 00:33:39.045
Don't call my name with that filthy mouth.

00:33:39.045 --> 00:33:42.335
I don't want to learn about your pain...

00:33:42.335 --> 00:33:44.115
ever.

00:34:11.155 --> 00:34:14.165
I assembled you here today because

00:34:14.165 --> 00:34:19.005
His Majesty wishes to abdicate the throne.

00:34:21.105 --> 00:34:22.825
Abdicate? Why all of a sudden?

00:34:22.825 --> 00:34:25.185
Because his health has deteriorated,

00:34:25.185 --> 00:34:27.935
he will not be able to discuss state affairs.

00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:31.235
But His Majesty does not have a successor yet.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:33.085
This is too sudden...

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:35.465
I will...

00:34:35.465 --> 00:34:41.385
hand over the throne to Prince Seonghyeon.

00:34:43.025 --> 00:34:46.645
Your Majesty, abdication is out of the question.

00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:49.795
The foundation of this country will falter.

00:34:49.795 --> 00:34:51.585
For your weakening health,

00:34:51.585 --> 00:34:53.965
you can rehabilitate briefly and regain strength.

00:34:53.965 --> 00:34:56.125
Please listen to our plea.

00:34:56.125 --> 00:34:59.515
<i>Please listen to our plea.</i>

00:34:59.515 --> 00:35:01.585
It is what His Majesty wants to do.

00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:03.985
Do not go against His Majesty's decision!

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:09.185
No one is more qualified than
Prince Seonghyeon to take over the throne.

00:35:09.185 --> 00:35:11.335
His Majesty is adamant about it.

00:35:11.335 --> 00:35:14.895
The royalty and the country's
future depend on this.

00:35:14.895 --> 00:35:16.575
Even if you abdicate,

00:35:16.575 --> 00:35:20.935
there are other royal relatives,
such as Prince Gyeongseong.

00:35:35.225 --> 00:35:37.455
Prince Gyeongseong is dead.

00:35:37.455 --> 00:35:41.065
Most importantly, he went
against the King's order.

00:35:41.065 --> 00:35:44.235
How dare you mention him in front of His Majesty?

00:35:46.045 --> 00:35:50.465
It is clear you are on Prince Gyeongseong's side.

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:54.165
Why are you doing this?

00:36:12.535 --> 00:36:14.855
There is a tavern just a little further.

00:36:14.855 --> 00:36:16.885
Let us catch a break there.

00:36:16.885 --> 00:36:17.935
Yes.

00:36:17.935 --> 00:36:19.955
Stop right there!

00:36:25.315 --> 00:36:27.295
What is this about?

00:36:29.565 --> 00:36:31.095
His Majesty ordered to arrest and transfer

00:36:31.095 --> 00:36:33.585
the traitor's daughter, Cha Sun Chaek.

00:36:33.585 --> 00:36:34.855
Pardon?

00:36:34.855 --> 00:36:36.405
Let go!

00:36:37.105 --> 00:36:40.005
Father! Father!

00:36:40.005 --> 00:36:41.365
Mother!

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:43.285
Arrest everyone.

00:36:43.285 --> 00:36:44.915
How dare you!

00:36:44.915 --> 00:36:46.985
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:50.125
Heuksa Clan's leader,
Chief State Minister Cha Ho Yeol

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:53.075
and his family will be arrested
according to the King's order.

00:36:53.075 --> 00:36:54.825
Heuksa Clan?

00:36:54.825 --> 00:36:57.295
That makes no sense at all.

00:36:58.275 --> 00:36:59.895
I found it!

00:37:11.665 --> 00:37:13.595
[General Gyeongseong is on
his way to kill the tyrannical King]

00:37:13.595 --> 00:37:17.915

00:39:49.955 --> 00:39:52.535
This must be hard for you, Sun Chaek.

00:39:52.535 --> 00:39:55.565
But this is the path you chose.

00:39:55.565 --> 00:39:57.445
You need to accept it, then.

of your youngest daughter.

prayed to the same figurine.

The result of a coincidence.

00:43:33.575 --> 00:43:37.765
Does it mean our bodies were switched, then?

00:43:37.765 --> 00:43:39.175
Yes.

00:43:40.135 --> 00:43:43.665
Anyway, I can't believe Cha Sun Chaek
became the female lead.

00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:44.915
I was a bit shocked.

00:43:44.915 --> 00:43:46.235

he became a crazy dog himself.

00:52:28.683 --> 00:52:32.113
Because dogs never bite their owners.

00:52:32.113 --> 00:52:35.633
In actuality, you probably
wanted to be on the throne.

00:52:36.693 --> 00:52:39.603
Prince Gyeongseong, who's been an eyesore, is gone

00:52:39.603 --> 00:52:41.983
and the Chief State Minister
was imprisoned for treason, too.

00:52:41.983 --> 00:52:46.933
It must be a perfect time to trick
His Majesty and take the throne.

00:52:49.253 --> 00:52:52.043
But be careful.

00:52:52.043 --> 00:52:54.443
The Heuksa Clan...

00:52:54.443 --> 00:52:57.773
Do you think they're all on your side?

00:53:05.543 --> 00:53:08.613
Truly, are you saying that for my sake?

00:53:11.703 --> 00:53:14.203
You're trying so hard...

00:53:15.243 --> 00:53:17.693
to save yourself.

00:53:39.183 --> 00:53:42.793
They say it is abdication,
but it is basically treason.

00:53:42.793 --> 00:53:45.603
We need to correct what is wrong.

00:53:46.613 --> 00:53:51.303
We need to be more loyal at times like this.

00:54:05.433 --> 00:54:07.313
Are you all right, Your Highness?

00:54:07.313 --> 00:54:10.143
Now that Prince Gyeongseong is gone,

00:54:10.143 --> 00:54:15.853
Prince Seonghyeon is the problem now.

00:54:15.853 --> 00:54:20.393
As soon as the King fell ill, he is showing

00:54:20.393 --> 00:54:23.783
his claws as if he has been waiting.

00:54:23.783 --> 00:54:27.673
I am afraid there would be...

00:54:27.673 --> 00:54:29.653
another bloodbath.

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.503
Your Highness.

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:38.903
Can we really trust Prince Seonghyeon?

00:55:08.543 --> 00:55:10.903
Are you playing the king right now?

00:55:10.903 --> 00:55:12.373
Play?

00:55:13.163 --> 00:55:15.843
I am about to become one soon.

00:55:15.843 --> 00:55:18.833
I will also give you another chance.

00:55:21.023 --> 00:55:22.663
Will you marry me?

00:55:22.663 --> 00:55:25.693
I said I would never, even if it killed me.

00:55:26.863 --> 00:55:29.293
If you marry me,

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:32.943
you will become the queen of this country.

00:55:36.503 --> 00:55:38.373
I can make you...

00:55:39.413 --> 00:55:42.833
the most powerful woman in this country.

00:55:47.383 --> 00:55:49.993
You are giving me no choice.

00:55:49.993 --> 00:55:52.163
If you really do not want to,

00:55:52.163 --> 00:55:54.883
I will have to take you forcibly.

00:55:55.843 --> 00:55:58.183
Easy is boring to me, too.

00:56:00.113 --> 00:56:02.243
Hear ye!

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:09.653
Bring this woman to my bedchamber!

00:56:17.483 --> 00:56:19.403
Catch her!

00:56:44.663 --> 00:56:46.793
What is it?

00:56:46.793 --> 00:56:49.253
Will you jump in or something?

00:56:51.703 --> 00:56:54.453
Are you afraid now that it is about to happen?

00:56:54.453 --> 00:56:56.943
Please wake up.

00:56:56.943 --> 00:57:00.043
You will get the last chance, then.

00:57:00.043 --> 00:57:02.823
A chance is not given.

00:57:03.823 --> 00:57:06.403
It is something you create.

00:57:09.253 --> 00:57:12.453
There is no need to go to the execution site.

00:57:13.433 --> 00:57:16.263
If you wish to die so badly,

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:22.223
I will make it happen.

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:39.853
My poor Sun Chaek.

00:57:41.043 --> 00:57:43.503
I do not want to do this, either-

00:57:46.113 --> 00:57:47.823
What are you doing?

00:57:47.823 --> 00:57:51.693
I decide when I'll die.

00:58:07.433 --> 00:58:11.093
I have been tolerating you
for the sake of our old ties.

00:58:14.143 --> 00:58:17.123
But your foolish decision is...

00:58:18.283 --> 00:58:21.843
hastening your death in the end.

00:58:28.833 --> 00:58:31.933
It is finally time to go, Sun Chaek.

00:59:49.653 --> 00:59:52.483
[The First Night with the Duke]

00:59:54.603 --> 01:00:01.243
<i>♫ Can't be expressed with any words ♫</i>

01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:08.303

01:00:08.303 --> 01:00:11.833

[Epilogue]

01:00:26.633 --> 01:00:29.513
It's our moment to make a decision.

01:00:29.513 --> 01:00:31.343
Have you decided?

01:00:31.343 --> 01:00:32.533
Have you?

01:00:32.533 --> 01:00:34.633
What would you like to do?

01:00:34.633 --> 01:00:39.613
I want to go where
Prince Gyeongseong is right now, but...

01:00:40.773 --> 01:00:42.653
We're good, then.

01:00:42.653 --> 01:00:45.233
I prefer my new life, too.

01:00:45.233 --> 01:00:47.573
- Really?
- Yes.

01:00:47.573 --> 01:00:52.063
This world is so freeing.

01:00:52.063 --> 01:00:53.833
You can be anything

01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:56.253
and go anywhere in this free world.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:58.033
This is what I've wanted.

01:00:58.033 --> 01:01:00.193
It's a relief...

01:01:00.193 --> 01:01:04.113
that we both like our new lives.

01:01:04.113 --> 01:01:06.353
Let's...

01:01:06.353 --> 01:01:08.183
be happy.

01:01:42.233 --> 01:01:44.233
Bye,

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.843
Kim Mo Eum.

01:01:46.743 --> 01:01:48.243
Bye,

01:01:49.263 --> 01:01:51.273
my Cha Sun Chaek.

01:02:12.553 --> 01:02:16.233
<i>I thought our great cause was
to create a different world.</i>

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:20.263
<i>We were ordered to kill anyone
who goes against the King.</i>

01:02:20.263 --> 01:02:24.243
<i>Please save the country that is
in crisis, Prince Gyeongseong.</i>

01:02:24.243 --> 01:02:26.393
<i>Are you sure you won't regret staying here?</i>

01:02:26.393 --> 01:02:30.093
<i>Even though you will reach the
ending and this world will end?</i>

01:02:30.093 --> 01:02:31.913
<i>We are inside a novel...</i>

01:02:31.913 --> 01:02:35.313
<i>and this world will disappear if the story ends?</i>

01:02:35.313 --> 01:02:37.143
<i>If I can be with you,</i>

01:02:37.143 --> 01:02:40.433

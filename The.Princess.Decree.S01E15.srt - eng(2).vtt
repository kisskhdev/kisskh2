You still dare to appear before me?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.560
This matter is not yet settled.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.680
I naturally had to return.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:24.560
I have come today to ask for
Your Highness's forgiveness.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.920
You…

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.160
Yuanze.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.920
Song.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.079
The matter I entrusted you with earlier,
is it done?

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.879
Rest assured.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.920
After Gan Sheng left,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.399
the spy from the Princess Residence

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:46.759
was thrown into the mass grave.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.420
I have already collected
the body properly, just as you instructed.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:50.920
Did Gan Sheng's men see it?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.079
At this moment, they must believe the spy
was one of ours.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.399
Good.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.040
Yuanze,

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.720
why do this?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.839
We could have used this chance

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.790
to sow discord between
Gan Sheng and Xiao Pingning

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.560
and let them fight each other.

I will

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.319
tell you everything later.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.959
Yuanze.

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.839
No matter what happens, I trust you.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:24.759
Rest early.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.959
There is still one urgent matter.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:33.879
Yesterday,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.519
I was blinded by villains
and believed their slander.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.680
I misunderstood Your Highness.

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:40.240
The spy in my residence

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.040
was planted by Li Yuanze
to drive a wedge between us.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:49.480
General, such courtesy

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.360
is more than I can accept.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.439
Your Highness.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.319
I was indeed too extreme in my actions.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.600
If Your Highness still holds anger,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.160
then perhaps

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.970
you may strike me back.

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.240
I do not wish to dirty my hands.

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.439
Step aside.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:12.759
Pingning.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.839
I was only afraid of losing you.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.399
I wanted to prove

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:18.800
that I could protect you.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.480
Yesterday,

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.680
my behavior was truly offensive.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.360
But the wish to marry you sooner

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.120
was not a moment of impulse.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:28.720
From this day on,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.120
your honor will be mine as well,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.920
and your loss will be mine.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.399
General,

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.920
since you know you misunderstood me,

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.319
why be so anxious?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.759
Have you forgotten

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.680
our agreement?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.000
Only when we
become husband and wife soon,

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.040
and no longer doubt each other,

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.160
can I fulfill Your Highness's wish
as early as possible.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.519
Is that not so?

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.079
This matter is of great importance.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.639
It cannot be decided in haste.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.319
Could it be

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.000
Your Highness is unwilling?

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:10.639
I…

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.519
This may not be appropriate.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.900
The late Emperor's mourning
is not yet over.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.879
Your Highness,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.199
are you truly so eager to be wed?

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:23.879
Insolence.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:24.879
My affairs

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.519
are not for you to meddle in.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.680
Li Yuanze.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.800
Remember your place.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.580
If Your Highness refuses to see me,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.440
I feel the same.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.879
If not for the command
of the Empress Dowager,

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.360
in this lifetime,

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.360
I would never set foot here again.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.799
The Empress Dowager issues a decree.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.590
The Princess Royal
is summoned to the palace

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.240
to organize the memorial ceremony
for the Imperial Consort.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.519
Your Highness,

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.799
receive the decree.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.240
Official Li,

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:10.559
thank you.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.879
You visit
the Princess Residence often enough.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.639
I will not see you out.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.279
Digging up graves at the mass pit

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:28.759
must have been unpleasant.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.320
You...

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.440
Li Yuanze,

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:35.279
there will be plenty more

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.320
days like this for you.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:39.600
General.

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:42.600
Something is wrong.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.970
There is trouble at the encampment.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.759
What happened?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:09:59.960
General,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.759
after you used Mr. Qingya's method

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:03.039
to win over the great clans,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.200
the reform

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.360
indeed went smoothly,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.039
and our military funding increased,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.320
but...

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.200
Get to the point.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.279
But because the military funds
increased so much,

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.320
the divisions began fighting over it.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.600
Everyone thought
their share was too small,

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:16.600
and conflicts broke out.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.039
Nonsense.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.850
How could these funds
be distributed straight to the...

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:24.919
It was the Ministry of Revenue.

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:28.159
Yes.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.679
The civil officials
pretended not to know,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.600
claiming it was an honest mistake.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.559
But they clearly did it on purpose.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:36.240
They want to use this money

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.679
to stir up discord among the generals.

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:40.679
General,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.639
what should we do now?

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.399
These wretched old schemers.

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:48.480
I will not let them have their way.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.650
Prepare to leave the city.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.990
I will handle the matter
at the encampment myself.

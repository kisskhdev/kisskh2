00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.096
After witnessing three matches

everyone's been waiting for,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.520

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.536
As you all know,

And in the blue corner,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.680
we have a world-renowned Thai boxer!
Poppy, the Savage Crusher, from the IBF.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.256
But, but, but!

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.776
We have a little change of plans today.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.376
A special surprise for all our audience.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.296
The upcoming bout will
be a lightning-fast rematch,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.320
between Typhoon, Roaring
Thunder in the red corner

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.456
and Thun, the Tiger-Taming
Cannon in the blue!

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.376
Thun!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.016
Shit…

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.896
Pakorn! You traitor!

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.576
And of course, our generous sponsor

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.336
would also like to give
back to the audience,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.616
by allowing everyone to take photos, record
videos, and live stream this match freely.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.776
Feel free to capture the atmosphere
of the event to your heart's content!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.856
What are you waiting for?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.336
Hi everyone, I'm here
live at the boxing stadium

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.160
and there's been a huge surprise!

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.736
Wait, hold on!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.136
Before we begin, we need
to thank a very special guest.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.856
MP Phuwish, our main sponsor,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.056
who made it possible for us
to organize this incredible event

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.256
for your viewing pleasure!

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.416
Let's give a big round of
applause for MP Phuwish!

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.520
Thank you so much, sir.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.656
Now, I'm sure everyone's
excited for the main event,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.496
so let's meet our fighters!

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.856

Woo! Yay!

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.960
And now the blue corner:

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.416
Thun, the Tiger-Taming
Cannon, from Petchsak Academy!

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.176
Woo!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.200
Cannon! Cannon!

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.800
No matter what happens.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.120
I love you, Ait.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.520
We'll get through this together, okay?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.560
I love you too.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.560
You've got this.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.776
No glove touching.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.560
Everyone understand? Go! Understood.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.880
Understood.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.360
Woo!

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.376
Typhoon!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.400
Good luck, I'm rooting for you.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.656
Come on, fighters.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.576
This is round one. Go all out.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.616
Round one, ready?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640
Fight!

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.440
Keep your guard up!

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.640
Go, go!

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.280
Fight!

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
Go Thun!

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.720
Break!

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.320
Ready? Fight!

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.256
Your punches have gotten heavier, Typhoon.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.320
Back then, if I landed that
punch, you would've hit the floor.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.816
Let me tell you something.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.416
I didn't take any drugs today.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.696
I wanted to fight you fair
and square, settle it all today.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.536
I know, that's what I also want.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.816
After I lost to you that day, I went
back and trained harder than ever.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.320
I told you, I have to be number one.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.736
And I'm sorry.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.216
I never really understood you back then.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.160
But now… I get you.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.240
Let's go, Thun! Punch him!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.016
You got this!

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.080
Thun!

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.656
Thun!

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.056
Hey! Thun, get up!

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.576
Thun, get up! Thun! Get up!

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.376
Get up! Get up!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.776
Thun!

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.536
Get up! Thun! Get up!

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.856
Shit, Thun!

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.656
Thun, get up!

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.696
Get up!

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.616
Kid, don't give in! Stand up and fight!

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.056
Hurry, go! Get up!

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.656
Hurry, go!

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.336
Thun, stay focused!

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.297
Thun!

00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:27.000
Get up, son.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.760
Get up!

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760
Keep on fighting, Thun!

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.520
I'm glad Keen brought
you to fight me today.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.776
I have to thank Keen too.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.880
Because I have
something I want to tell you.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.440
Let's be friends again, Typhoon.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.096
Yeah bro, I've been waiting
for you. Come on, Thun.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.896
Thun! Get up!

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.136
Thun! Get up!

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.216
Keep on fighting, Thun!

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.576
You got this!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.536
Quickly, Thun!

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.760
Thun, get up!

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.136
Typhoon! Get up!

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.056
Thun, get up! Typhoon!

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.057
Uh...

00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:40.496
Thun, you can do it.
Calm down and focus.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.816
You're doing great Thun!

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.497
So good!

00:10:42.521 --> 00:10:45.760
Get up!

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.296
Blue corner!

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.000
Red corner!

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.600
Fight!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.816
Good! That's it, Thun!

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.840
Uh...

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800
Go!

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.256
Yay!

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.840
Woo!

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.520
Get up!

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.400
Ready! Fight!

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.400
Stop!

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.760
If you're ready, round five! Fight!

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.096
Get up!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.320
Fight!

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.320
Uh... Come on!

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.136
Thun, you're doing great!

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.480
Fight!

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.280
Secure Coach Petch and
get him out of here now.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.176
Thun, get up!

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200
Get up!

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.896
That's great!

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.936
If you're ready, fight!

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.696
Stop! Go to your corners!

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:05.720
Typhon! Cannon!

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.976
Cannon!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.696
Typhon! Cannon!

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.096
Typhon!

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.120
Typhon! Cannon!

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:41.960
Yay! Woo!

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.216
That's it! That's my boy.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.416
Hey! Hey! Chief!

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.536
Cannon!

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.320
Yay!

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.760
Yay!

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.080
Thun!

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.656
We've won!

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.680
We've finally won!

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.616
You were so good!

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.040
So good!

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.520
Thun, Phuwish's gone.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.040
Let's go.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.576
Gather all our men and block all the exits.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.696
Capture everyone from Petchsak
Academy, especially Keen.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.896
You got it?

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.080
Yes, sir.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.736
You don't have to look for us, Mr.Phuwish.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760
We've come to find you.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.240
Wow, you've got guts.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.176
You're so brave to insult me. Haha.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.800
You're brave and stupid too!

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.376
Such a waste.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.016
Thun.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.577
Keen.

00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:17.120
Why would you throw away
the opportunities I've given you?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.696
Opportunities?

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.320
Yes. The opportunity to be your slave?

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.176
No way.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.800
Who'd want to be your toy?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.320
In that case...

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.296
Let's do it this way!

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:51.897
How?

00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:54.600
How? Huh?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.416
Aren't you afraid people
will hear the gunshots?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.120
Didn't I tell you this room is soundproof?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.600
You still have a chance.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.880
Change your mind.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.880
Change your mind.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.080
Be mine, come on.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600
Come.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.400
Otherwise, you'll die just like your father.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.216
Toy, fight him!

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.216
Damn it!

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240
Uh..

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.696
Come on.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.880
Make this fun.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.976
At first, I thought your dad
came to be some kind of hero.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.456
Turns out, he just came to avenge your mom
after we tricked her into giving us her money,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:59.000
she was so stressed her brain vessel burst.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.096
All that effort was for nothing.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.120
What the fuck are you doing?

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.456
I'm going to return the money to everyone.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.040
You've got a lot of nerve doing this.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.496
Do you know what happens
to people who betray Sia Thep?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.520
Huh?!

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.400
You know, right?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.760
Come here.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.016
He died for nothing.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.256
Bastard! Keen!

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.976
Don't come any closer!

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.256
Don't!

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.616
Don't you lay a finger on Keen!

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.640
Step back!

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.696
I gave you a chance,
why would you betray me?!

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.616
This is your final chance.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.360
Think carefully.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.016
Give me the code.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.216
Give me the code!

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.040
Don't you dare.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.176
You're just like your father.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.816
When I tortured him to death, he
still refused to give me the code.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.856
Oh? How about this, Keen?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.616
I'll shoot Thun, the
person you love so much.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.296
Let's see if you'll give me the code then.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.056
Let's get closer, Keen.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.720
A bit more…

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.856
Right?

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.976
Agh! Hahaha!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.096
What the fuck is wrong with you! Huh!?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:57.016
Wow… It's kind of funny, isn't it?
A smart and powerful man like you

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.256
getting tricked so easily by
a rookie in the boxing scene.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.120
Why don't you say hello to the
folks in the arena, MP Phuwish?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.416
That's Phuwish's voice!
What's going on?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.320
Oops, or should I say Sia Thep?

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.880
Hey! What is this?

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:49.400
I'm Sergeant Kanchit Rojanametheephong.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.016
That voice sounds really familiar…

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:02.136
And this footage contains
evidence of MP Phuwish's crimes,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.536
confirming that MP Phuwish and Sia Thep,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.440
the crime lord in the boxing
world, are the same person.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.440
Whoa…

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:24.936
Toy! You were a mole?! Went from
punching guts to turning cocoon, huh?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.320
Keep doing it!

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.176
Harder!

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.880
Crank it up! You idiot!

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.080
Ow!

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.616
All you had to do was fake a
voice or face of someone familiar

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.016
or pretend to be some kind of official.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.936
Just remember, the only
goal is to wrap the job up fast.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.056
Humans, when they're under pressure,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.856
they lose their minds and
before they know it, the money

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.056
is already in our hands.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:13.080
So let's go. Everyone
ready? Operation begins.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.496
This is Dynamitol.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.377
Whoa…

00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:25.936
It's a new drug formula, Boss.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.856
Right now, no current anti-doping
methods can detect this substance.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.817
Ahh.

00:23:30.841 --> 00:23:35.536
But if you use too much, it'll
damage the body in the long run.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.336
That's fine. I don't care about that.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.176
All I care about is making
the fight entertaining.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.496
I hope this footage
leads to your prosecution,

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.896
and justice for all of Phuwish's victims.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.816
If that happens, I can die in peace.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.960
Hey!

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.416
Don't come any closer!

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.336
Stop! You can't film this! What?

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.936
What are you doing with my phone?!

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.056
Wait! Are you one of them?!

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.577
Hey!

00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:08.320
Whoop his ass!

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.360
It's chaos now.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.056
Keep recording, keep filming!

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.696
Where's that room?

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.216
Over there! Come on, let's go check it out.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.096
Take care of yourself, okay?
I'm right here.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.000
Okay, okay.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.680
Everyone, it's total chaos now!

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Get up!

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.096
Don't come closer or
I'll shoot your guts out!

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.120
Keen!

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.696
That's enough now. MP Phuwish.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.537
Don't take pictures!

00:24:43.561 --> 00:24:44.960
Get out!

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.480
Don't film!

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.296
Don't film me!

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.696
Film everything!

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.856
Damn it! Get out! Aaaah!

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.777
I told you not to film!

00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:56.416
Stop!

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.976
Drop it!

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.320
Back off!

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.680
Keen.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.840
I'm sorry I wasn't there
by your side like I promised.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.440
But I want you to know

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.920
I'll always be with you, Keen.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.880
Keen.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
You did so well.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.080
I'm proud of you, son.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760
Keen...

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.400
It's over now.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.520
It's okay.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.760
Dad, I've done it.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.456
Go.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.680
Move.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.440
Yut!

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.720
Hey!

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.657
Coach Petch, are you okay?

00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:36.136
I'm fine.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.520
What the hell did you
doing to Uncle Petch?!

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.256
That's all you've got, huh?

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.080
You weakling.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.856
Get up.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.936
Coach, be careful!

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.216
I'm the master of all martial arts!

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.256
Who the hell are you?

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.000
You'll find out soon enough.
You can't do anything to me.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.216
You're just a master.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.560
I'm the Jade Executioner.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.400
Come on, let's get out of here!
Yeah, let's go!

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760
Damn it!

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520
Argh!!

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.600
Looking for something, Mr. Phuwish?

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.536
Pakorn.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.320
You traitor, I'm going to kill you!

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.800
You're not speaking
very politely today, sir.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.736
Jonathan.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.520
Jonathan!

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.280
Jonathan!

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.080
Why are you guys here?

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.920
Why?

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.656
What?

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.656
Why?

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.616
Hey! I'll kill all of you!

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.080
Hey! What?

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.936
Let go of me!

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.320
Pakorn! Let me go or you're all dead!

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.416
You wanna die, huh?

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.856
Ow!

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.216
Let me go!

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.176
You're all dead once I get out of here!

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.776
Pakorn, help me!

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.520
Hungry, are we?

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.256
Now it's your turn to be the bitch.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.936
Your dad's a bitch!

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.696
Tough guy, huh?

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.280
Eat.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.080
What the hell did you give me?

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.960
Help... me...

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.120
If that's all, I'll take my leave now.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.736
All done?

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.960
Yeah, all done.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.440
What did the police say?

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:12.080
They asked how we got
involved with Sia Thep.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:19.176
Thun told them about the
fight ring in the warehouse.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.080
You should've seen the
officer's face when he heard it.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.960
If I hadn't seen it myself, I
wouldn't have believed it.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.800
So sketchy.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Secret society.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.160
Underground fight club.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.560
I've only ever seen
stuff like that in movies.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.216
And then when the guy came at
me, I punched him right in the face.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.616
He was like “Sorry! I give up!”

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.856
“I've got a family to feed!”
But I didn't let him go.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.880
I was like, left, right, left, right!

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:08.760
You once told me I was
all you had left, right?

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:27.656
But I want you to know, Keen, that now

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:34.600
everyone in the Petchsak
camp is your family too.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.456
You're like a grandson to me now.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.936
And the Petchsak boxing
camp is your home too.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.416
Thank you, Uncle Petch.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.416
Thank you, officer.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.536
Thanks so much.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.336
You know if you exaggerate too much, you
could be charged with false testimony, right?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.656
That's prison time.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.497
I wasn't lying!

00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:05.360
Sure, sure. Big talker.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.000
Thank you, everyone.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.880
Really, thank you.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.336
You're hogging the hugs!

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.160
Let me in too!

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.496
That's it.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.840
It's all over.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.280
You did great.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.216
In trending news online right now...

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:17.976
A video of Auntie Bua receiving a mysterious
bag of money left in front of her house.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.656
Back when I got scammed
by a call center gang,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.016
I just wanted to die.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.520
But now, I don't want to die
anymore. I got my money back!

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.936
And how do you know it was yours, auntie?

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.776
Inside the bag, there was a note saying
it was the money the scammers had taken

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.656
and someone went and got it back for me!

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.096
Bless you, that person!

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.936
In our next story, today marks the one-year
anniversary of the discovery of the body of MP Phuwish,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.576
or the infamous Sia Thep,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.936
found dead in an abandoned factory.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.536
Yut, the ex-boxer and
Boss Thep's right-hand man,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.736
was sentenced to life in prison for assault,
unlawful confinement, conspiracy to murder,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.616
as well as charges of
fraud and money laundering.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:13.696
The director of Ekarin Hospital, was arrested for
involvement in producing a new illegal stimulant

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:21.096
called Dynamitol, Police have seized
and destroyed all known samples.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.776
The crackdown on Boss Thep's organization also led to
the dismantling of major scam and call center syndicates,

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.656
involving billions of baht in circulation.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:35.536
Pakorn, former boxing promoter and
fighter, was also sentenced for conspiracy.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.936
Sia Thep had evaded justice for so long
due to protection from high-ranking police,

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.576
who helped cover up
murders and fraud cases.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:51.600
The police chief has now announced the formation
of a new committee to investigate further.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.616
Hello?

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.217
Hi.

00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:19.241
Listen, I've got a very special
offer that you might be interested in.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.080
Hmm. You're working hard.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.920
Well, I want our boxing camp to go global.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.496
Oh, Keen...

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.256
Hmm?

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.360
I got a call from Japan just now.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:27.856
The IBF in Japan wants to invite
mr to be a boxing coach there.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.976
They'll cover all my expenses.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.976
Food, housing, and even pocket money.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Whoa...

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.600
But...

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.416
It's a long-term contract.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.720
Two years.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.800
International Boxing
Federation in Japan, right?

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.936
Sounds interesting.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.760
What do you think, Thun?

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:30.920
I don't know yet, I haven't
really thought about it yet.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.776
I think that..

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.360
It's a great opportunity.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.520
How are you guys doing, Keen? Thun?

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.640
Hello.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.976
I heard from Klao you were released today,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.816
didn't expect you to come find us so soon.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.576
They reduced my sentence because I gave
useful testimony and helped expose Phuwish.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.960
But I still have to wear
this EM ankle monitor.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.720
Must be tough, huh?

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.480
Not as tough as what you two went through.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.040
I owe both of you an apology.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.576
You don't need to apologize to us, Dad.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.976
We understand now.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.480
Right, Thun?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Yeah.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.296
It's okay, Keen.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.520
I understand both of you.

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:52.720
You two stood up to Sia
Thep's power so bravely.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.160
You've already gone far
beyond an old man like me.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.880
I know you're still angry at me, Thun.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.600
But.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:21.600
I hope what I did in the end

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:30.840
might help you forgive me someday.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.800
Dad.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.600
I'm sorry for ever calling you a coward.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.400
Thank you...

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.320
Dad.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:36.520
Come visit your mom at home sometime, okay?

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.856
Hey Win, can I ask you something?

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.096
You don't do your trading stuff anymore?

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.536
I quit, Dad. It wasn't as easy
to make money as I thought.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.616
More people lose than win.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.856
And the charts just keep
swinging up and down.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.216
I can't stare at them all day.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.440
Hmm.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.616
I've been in a boxing
camp since I was a kid.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.056
I'd rather come back and help run the gym.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.520
Good, come help your old man at the camp.

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.216
Hello Ait.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.720
Hi, Kaew.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.976
Hello, Uncle Petch.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.336
Hi. Hello, Mawin.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.976
Hello.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.336
Study hard, Kaew.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.856
Once your tutoring's
done, I'll take you out to eat.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.776
Let's go hang out at Thun
and Keen's place, okay?

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.856
Sounds great!

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.480
Good.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.696
How's it going, Typhoon? Done training?

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.457
All done.

00:48:23.481 --> 00:48:25.496
You ready for tomorrow's fight?

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.296
Ready. 100% fit.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.576
Good.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.936
A fighter like Typhoon Roaring Thunder won't
let the Petchsak Camp down, right Coach Petch?

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.696
And you, Mai, ready for
your first match tomorrow?

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.016
Don't worry, Coach.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.920
Typhoon trained me hard, no holding back!

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:47.977
Ow ow ow!

00:48:48.001 --> 00:48:50.536
So fired up! Hyper as always!

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:56.016
Hey, Mawin, the scale's busted again.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.656
Again?!

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.576
Alright, Ait and I will handle it.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.096
You go back to training.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.617
Come on, go.

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:07.416
Back to training. 15 rounds, let's go!

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.976
Whoa, Typhoon!

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.440
(Petchsak Boxing Camp)

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.240
Hey.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:26.216
You're still not done? You've
been working on that forever.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.400
Yeah, I think it's really busted this time.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.456
Geez, if it breaks this
often, just buy a new one!

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.000
Yeah... I thought about that.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.480
But I think I'll keep this one.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.496
Why, though?

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.600
It's totally wrecked. Just toss it.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.320
I can't bring myself to throw it away.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:55.120
Even though it's broken, it's
proof that I once lost my way

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.920
and found my way back
by fixing this very machine.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.080
Wait, are we still talking about the scale?

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.960
I'm talking about scale.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:23.096
As for the person, he's been repaired too.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.216
Don't get all sappy on me.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.456
Go finish training.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.480
Yeah yeah, I got it.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:56.240
Dad, I've used the money in the wallet to
do what you had intended to do all along.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.936
I've returned the money to
everyone who had been scammed.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:12.936
Thanks to the evidence you gathered,
we were able to track down every victim.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.600
As for their addresses, someone helped us.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.840
All done, right?

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.256
Thank you so much, Uncle
Nop, for handling all of that.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.456
Let me do this to make
up for what I didn't do.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.840
Back then, I couldn't help your dad.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.880
I've regretted that ever since.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.000
It's okay, I understand.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.200
You must've been under
pressure from higher-ups too.

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.736
Even so, I still have the
responsibility to do this.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:04.440
Besides, tracking people
down isn't that hard.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:10.176
Really, I should thank you,
Keen, for giving me this chance

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.720
to make it up to Kanchit.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:20.920
I believe if your dad could see you now,

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.080
he'd be really proud of you.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.656
I'll be going now.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.160
Alright.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.616
Mom, Dad. You don't have to worry anymore.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:13.240
From now on, no one else will suffer from
Sia Thep's gang the way our family did.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.136
You don't have to worry
about Keen anymore either.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:31.160
From now on, I'll always be by
Keen's side. I'll take care of him for you.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.680
One, two, three, change positions!

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.976
Mai, take a nice photo
of my sister, alright?

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.560
I'll make her look her absolute best, bro!

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.296
How did you take this,
huh? Why do I look so fat?

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.456
Fat?

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.000
What are you smiling
about, all by yourself?

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:13.040
I'm just proud, I finally
bought this house back.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.640
Come on, let's join everyone else.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.800
Let's go.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.776
Ait, are you done yet? I'm starving!

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.777
Just a sec!

00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:58.640
Ugh, can't wait anymore.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.976
Klao, give me the super spicy sauce!

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:03.537
You got it!

00:56:03.561 --> 00:56:06.200
Whoa, that's too spicy!

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.360
Change pose, change pose!

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:14.080
Alright, this one's done! Fresh off
the grill! Whoa, looks mouthwatering.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.976
Here it comes!

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.016
Dipping sauce is ready!

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.456
Let's see… Looks delicious.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.856
Such a spicy-looking color.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.256
Of course! No doubt.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.320
Whoa, whoa.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.736
So we can dig in now, right?
Yep, let's eat, go on!

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.096
Grab whatever you want!
Me first, me first!

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.296
Go ahead! Shrimp, shrimp!

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.016
Hey!

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.016
We're not gonna get to
eat if you keep that up!

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.976
Mai, be careful, man!

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.056
If the shrimp falls, it'd be
such a waste! It's expensive!

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.376
Sorry, sorry! Mmm.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.376
Alright, eat up! Thanks!

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.776
What would you like to eat, Kaew?

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.056
You know, I've never peeled
shrimp for anyone before.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.017
The sauce is really good.

00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:51.336
Right?

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.000
It's a little sour though.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.296
Hey, I wanna eat too!

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.016
Hmph.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.456
You're making me crave it now.
Might be too sweet, though?

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.520
Here, here.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.216
So good!

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.496
Hey, this one fell!

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.016
Everyone, let's take a group photo!

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.336
Come on, come on!

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.696
Tilt your heads in.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.720
One, two, three!

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.696
Ugh, I'm tired.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.000
Those guys came to eat and
didn't help clean anything up.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:27.800
Come on, at least we
get some alone time now.

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.960
Even washing dishes counts, right?

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.000
Thun, the plate's gonna break!

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.680
You scared the plate might break,
or something else might break?

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.520
You're the one who should be afraid.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.560
So, did anything break last night?

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.056
Ugh, you perv!

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.776
The plate! What are you even thinking?!

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.880
Ohhh, right... the plate. Got it.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.320
Hey, I brought something
for you to try, Keen.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.040
What is it?

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.720
Something I came up with myself.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960
It'll be easy.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
Let go!

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:28.040
I made mistakes too, I knew you were
only doing all that because of the debt.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.120
Do you still want to stay at the gym?

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.656
Do you want me to stay?

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.720
Yes. Stay with me, Keen.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.896
Yay! All sold out!

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.160
Sold out!

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.040
If you don't know how
to stop thinking about it,

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.080
just think about me. That's enough.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.480
Wow, how did you do it?

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:21.520
So, have you decided yet about
going to Japan to teach boxing?

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.840
I've actually already made up my mind.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.920
Yeah?

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.480
So finish it.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.360
Do you know yet?

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.800
Yeah.
